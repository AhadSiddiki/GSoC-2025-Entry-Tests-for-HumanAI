1jckrs8,2025-03-16 18:52:18,Everyone's living their life and i'm vegetating.,"I am severely depressed, have no boyfriend, family or friends. I work full time but apart from that i'm just playing video games and hoping that my life will soon end.

People from my past are all living their life. They start a family, are constantly traveling, overall broadening their horizons. I know it's not the right thing to focus on other people's life (not always reality), but it makes me so unhappy. I had a lot of dreams, aspirations.

My past and the depression took everything from me. My childhood was a living hell, during school and now in worklife i always get bullied. I always end up with abusive boyfriends (one of them r\*ped me). Friends always backstabbed or betrayed me.

I'm now at a point, where i don't trust anyone. I'm just so done with life and other humans. I cut ties to my family and the couple ""friends"" i still had. I just couldn't take it any longer.

I'm all alone now. I know this is not healthy and the right thing. But how do you continue? I always try and try and try...am hopeful. But it always ends up in failure.

I also tried a lot of therapies, but i don't believe in it any more. I focus on my medication, so that i can function and handle my life.

I didn't want this life but it seems i have to torment myself, until my time has come.

I really don't know to continue from this point on.

And i really can't hear bull like think positive, it will get better.

I really don't know how i can turn my life around.

I genuinely despise the words ""attitude"" and ""mindset"" and wish to see them permanently expunged from the English vocabulary. Incidentally, none of the counsellors or therapists I've seen over the years have used those two words with me. It's only people who explicitly *aren't* healthcare professionals who say those words within my earshot. I wonder why that is.

I legitimately wonder if I have a neurological disorder that better explains why I'm so passive and avoidant, because others who apparently have depression seemingly do not understand, at least not anymore. Not that I'd expect to be taken seriously by healthcare professionals if I were to ask.

I guess I'm not the relatively acceptable type of depressed where I'm ""resilient"" enough or whatever to still take care of myself and live independently. ""Okay, *I* am depressed, *I* hate myself, but at least I brush my teeth/go outside/drink water/eat actual meals, you have no excuse"" - okay, congratulations. Cool. I don't know what you expect me to do with this information. Hearing it has increased the concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, and whatever ""willpower"" is in my brain by an astounding 0.000000000%. It may well have further depleted them, if anything.

Then there's the idea that if I ""hit rock bottom"" I'll magically improve because I ""have to."" I doubt it. If I were on the brink of homelessness, that wouldn't magically make me employable, or make me successfully get a job. I'd just be homeless. It doesn't work out for everyone like that. Just world fallacy, and so on.

I can understand how the always living have been deluded into thinking that we ""want"" or ""choose"" to be the way. But I genuinely do not understand how people more functional than me, who claim to have once been as nonfunctional as me, who apparently have/had depression, also delude themselves into thinking that those who didn't survive with them, who didn't get to go with them, only didn't do so because they ""chose"" or ""wanted"" to stay behind.

Is there something I can actually do to break myself apart and rebuild it all over again?

I'm short (5""4 - 5""5). I sweat a lot and way too fast it's so fucking gross (hyperhidrosis) I feel disgusted looking at myself in the mirror. My hands be sweating so hard that I drip sweat. It also makes me feel like I smell so bad and feel so icky. This shit got no cure.

I got mental issues, there's not a day where I don't think of killing myself. I'm fucking tired of this shit. I take medication but it has done shit and I still feel fucking numb and abnormal. Sometimes I lie to my doctor to keep the same medication because it's the only one that is covered by health insurance and they think increasing or keeping the same dose is helping. It's fucking not and they probably don't give a shit about me.

Some days I don't even want to get out of bed cause what's the point. I can't even fucking sleep (insomnia) and I get jealous of my other family members cause they can fucking sleep in a coupIe of hours. I deliberately stay up late at 2-3 AM cause I take few hours to sleep anyways and I wouldn't be doing shit all day anyways and just rot in bed. My brain wanna die but my body wants to stay alive for what. More than half the time I don't even got any energy to do anything so I'm just running autopilot.

I have skin issues (ezcema) makes my fucking hands red and itchy. Sometimes it looks like I got bloody knuckles from punching someone. This shit also ain't got no cure.

I got no job and the only fucking thing I got going for me is finishing school.

I got no real life friends and I can't fucking talk to nobody not even my fucking family. People think family is a support system but they don't support shit cause they don't know how to help me. My family be like ""what's wrong"" and I'm like do not see what's wrong me like holy shit have some empathy for once my fucking god. Mental health is taboo in my culture and my family arent depressed and are mentally stable so why the fuck did I get it. Therapists will just read off a script and say the most obvious shit like I didn't already know that.

Every social interaction makes me want to die. People younger than me can this shit so easily so why the fuck can't I. People in general don't like fucking quiet people. I'm too fucking sensitive to everything and even the slightly trigger will cause me to spiral.

My siblings are every which way better and I'm just fucking exist. They got careers and a future. I think I'm actually just mentally stupid. I am really slow in doing stuff and thinking. Decades of stress fucked my memory so half the time I can't recall shit.

I live with my mom that acts like a tyrant and it feels like I'm being held fucking hostage. I can't have nothing and will give me nothing. I can't fucking go out anywhere or allowed to. I can't even fucking have pets. Shit even when my family moved here 4 years ago I was promised my own room but the house wasnt big enough to split up the space like thats not my fucking fault. Gets mad when I stay up late thats because you didn't give my own room like what the fuck. I don't even think I would be able to move out cause I'm broke as shit. I can't speak up for myself cause I don't got the confidence.

I'm a grown man so I should be allowed to do whatever the fuck I want but I can't. I feel like a fucking child.

Like shit man I think I was just set up for failure in this world.

How the fuck am I supposed to love myself when the cards are clearly stacked against me. I feel like a fucking monster.

Why am I still living cause it feels like I'm already dead but a ghost carrying all the trauma.

Fuck whoever wronged me in the past cause I can't let this shit go no matter how hard I try.

I fucking want out of this world. 23 years of long and hard pain and I don't want to suffer any longer anymore. I never had a single good thing that happened in my life before. People say it gets better but it just doesn't fucking get better. People tell me to just not be pessimistic like if you weren't ignorant and lived my life you would shut the fuck up.

1jeq2vd,2025-03-19 11:39:09,I believe my bf deserves better,"
I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years. He is lovely, a very kind person, attractive, beautiful smile and body, very damn smart, funny, caring, and overall a great man and a great partner. From him I’ve gotten great inspiration because he’s always trying to be the best version of himself; On the other hand I am what other people would classify as the “loser girlfriend”, I am quite the complete opposite to him, not very good looking, ugly af smile, dumb and stupid, plain and flat body, maybe sometimes funny but most of the time I’m just very uncomfortable to be around.

I don’t do much, I just sleep and clean, I talk to nobody but him, I am severely depressed but I haven’t mentioned it to him because he def doesn’t need to have more burdens in his life. 

Lately I’ve seriously considered offing myself, I won’t go into detail but I have plenty of reasons to believe is the best option.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years. He is lovely, a very kind person, attractive, beautiful smile and body, very damn smart, funny, caring, and overall a great man and a great partner. From him I’ve gotten great inspiration because he’s always trying to be the best version of himself; On the other hand I am what other people would classify as the “loser girlfriend”, I am quite the complete opposite to him, not very good looking, ugly af smile, dumb and stupid, plain and flat body, maybe sometimes funny but most of the time I’m just very uncomfortable to be around.

I don’t do much, I just sleep and clean, I talk to nobody but him, I am severely depressed but I haven’t mentioned it to him because he def doesn’t need to have more burdens in his life. 

Lately I’ve seriously considered offing myself, I won’t go into detail but I have plenty of reasons to believe is the best option.

1jfxral,2025-03-21 01:48:31,31M afraid i'll end up alone without kids,"Hi everyone,

I (31M) feel like I’ve hit a point in my life where I’m genuinely scared I’ll never have a family of my own. I consider myself good-looking, intelligent, well-traveled, and successful. I have a great career, a house, a dog, and many hobbies—I sing, play music, play sports, have a pilot’s license, and love to cook. I make good money, and I’ve had relationships with beautiful women, but they always came with problems. I don’t know if I’ve been too picky or if I just made the wrong choices, but looking back, I regret some relationships that might have been ""the one.""

All of my friends—literally every single one—are either already parents or will be soon. I’m even a godfather to three kids, and I love children. But here I am, 31, still alone, and it’s starting to feel like I might never experience fatherhood or even a real, lasting love.

I live in a small town where everyone knows each other. I’ve been through dating apps three times over, and I feel like I’ve seen it all. The women my age who are single usually have good reasons for it (speaking from experience), or they already have kids—and while I respect that, I’m not ready to be a stepdad. For some reason, I don’t seem to attract younger women (24-28), and my options feel more limited every year.

I feel like I can’t afford to be picky anymore, but at the same time, I know I have a lot to offer. I have so much love to give, and I genuinely want to devote myself to a partner. Life feels empty without someone to share it with. All my friends are building beautiful families, and I feel like the odd one out.

People keep telling me, “You’ll find someone someday,” but I feel like my window is closing, and it’s making me anxious.

1jey3jx,2025-03-19 20:20:30,An emotional dump from a very private man,"This is my first ever Reddit post, but feeling like I need to put this out there. I’m a 35 year old male, I have a great job, a solid career and good health. About 5 years ago my fiancé of 8 years broke up with me, there was no foul play, she found herself in her own midlife/career crisis and needed to spend time alone to figure her own shit out. It was mostly amicable with the exception of some tough conversations. We had to sell our home that we had purchased only 3 years prior, all of which took place spring 2020 as the entire world was shutting down. At the same time as dealing with a break up, selling a home and moving, I was forced into isolation and was working 60hour weeks in the medical field. 

The first 6 months were mostly okay, I was focused a lot on eating right and working out. I felt good about seeing progress, and I had made a good chunk of cash from the sale of the home. My plan was to take a couple of years to settle into a new life, then perhaps get out into the dating scene. That’s not what happened. 5 months after selling the home and moving out, I made the mistake of curiously setting up a tinder “just to see what it’s all about”. I was isolated and lonely, and also curious about dating. I matched with several people, chatted with a couple, and went out to meet one for drinks. The first date was a blast, tons of fun and an instant connection. I knew it was too soon, and I knew it wasn’t healthy, but it was fun and exciting so I leaned in. One date turned to many more, which then turned into a relationship, and in less than two years from my break up I was moving in with this person. I thought I had hit the jackpot, I had found such a great person so easily and quickly. Well, I was wrong.

Shortly after moving in I discovered this person 
had been sleeping around behind my back, and hiding a cocaine and crystal meth habit the whole time. I literally found the stash multiple times. When confronted I got one sob story after another and a promise to stop, mixed in with a ton of gaslighting and angry reactions including physical aggression. Needless to say, after living there for a year and wishfully hoping it would get better, it didn’t, and I was moving out again in less than a year. I had also blown all my savings when with this person, which was totally ny responsibility, but found my self in a position of living paycheck to paycheck. 

So here I go again, moving into a new apartment, starting over again and dealing with a highly toxic break up. I was always a casual week smoker, but weed became my crutch, I was smoking every day, sometimes before and after work. I had for the first time in my life major episodes of depression and anxiety, intermittent moments of panic, and a total loss of self control. I stopped working out, gained weight and was eating trash food constantly. I started isolating from friends and family, and all I wanted was to be home alone with weed and food. 

Here I am, two years later, and still doing the same thing. I feel so stuck, I’ve tried so many times to pull myself together, every Monday I promise myself a fresh start but the urge to smoke is so hard to resist, and I still have tons of anxiety about being in debt, and days of feeling like the whole thing is pointless. I had suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life which has been terrifying, but I know I will never do that, because I can’t stand the thought of how much pain it would cause others. I beat myself up for getting into this position, and I’m totally aware that I am lucky in many ways, good health, great friends/family, good career, a home to live in etc. 

Anyway, apologies for the novel, it’s been a busy five years for me. Literally nobody knows my struggle, I mask it all and make sure nobody sees how bad things are. I have always been an incredibly private person emotionally, hence the emotional dump here. I am hanging onto hope that one day soon I’ll find the strength and discipline to get my shit together. If you took a minute to read this, thank you.

1jgam82,2025-03-21 12:37:47,I hate myself and I hate everything,"Hello
I don’t know what’s the point of writing this and whether anyone is going to read it.
But I need to say it
I hate myself 
From a young age I knew I wasn’t attractive 
and people made sure I knew
I remember my father trying to cover my big forehead with my hair when I was 7
I remember him telling me to get inside and to stop playing with the girls because “you’re too old” when I was the youngest of the group.
I remember friends making fun of my looks in high school, “I’ve never seen a nose bigger than yours”
“Baldie” , “you have no eyelashes”

I remember my sister telling me I look like in my thirties when I was only 18
I remember when we were swimming and as my sister was taking pictures of us I asked her to only take a picture of me if I look good, she looked through the camera and said no you don’t look good. Her face looked very sorry 

I met someone a few months back, she mistook for my older sister who’s 15 years older than me.
And she actually said you look more like your older sisters 

I got married a few years ago and a few months after we got married my husband told me he didn’t find me attractive first but got used to it 
I cried so much after that and I kept crying every time I remember that
We don’t even have sex that often , even in our honeymoon and I know that that is because I’m ugly
I hate hime for that
I wish we didn’t get married 
But we have a baby now

My baby is really cute and im glad she is
I don’t want her to feel the way I felt my whole life
Some people commented on how cute she is and I asked does she look like me, all of them said Noo! 
It hurrtssss

I hate myself
I hate everything about me
Inside and outside 
I hate the way I think
How depressed i am

I don’t want my baby to grow up with a mother like me
I don’t know how to make it right 

I tried therapy for years. it didn’t work for me
I tried burying myself in work
I tried being positive and doing hobbies 
I tried everything 
Every thing

I don’t know what to do

I’m getting uglier by the year
I lost half of my already thin hair after having the baby
You could see my scalp from a million miles away

I gained 30 kgs

My body is covered in body acne and stretch marks
We barely have sex anymore 

Part of the reason is that i hate myself and don’t want my husband to look at my body 
And he doesn’t even initiate any form of intimacy that leads to that

I stopped taking care of myself because I have done that, and look where it led me.

Every night I go to sleep I pray I never wake up
Not because I’m ugly on the outside , but because it’s even worse in my head.

1jh0zxp,2025-03-22 11:00:19,Is getting older and surviving worth it?,"

I’ve struggled with self-esteem, codependency, and loss, and for a long time, I distracted myself from facing reality. Now, after therapy and self-reflection, it feels like I’ve woken up, and the weight of everything is hitting me at once. I overthink, stress about the past, and fear for the future—anxiety and panic attacks happen, politics and the weight of everything, especially about what would happen if I lost my parent, since I still rely on them financially even though I am an adult that hit rock bottom and didn’t have a job for a while. I feel stuck, alone, and unsure of how to move forward.

The good news? I got hired this week. The bad news? Because of uncertainty, I might only get one day of work. I’m trying, but everything feels so uncertain especially because of the crap happening in the world right now, and I don’t know where to go from here. Today I caught myself feeling depressed—do I really want to survive this? The thought of my last living parent—passing away is hitting me hard lately. I know it’s natural and it’s going to happen but I don’t think finically, mentally or emotionally I am ready for it. I can’t even picture a future without them in my life. I have two dogs that need me but idk if I’m going to be alright once it happens. And dating is a joke nowadays—I can’t find a good connection with anyone plus I don’t want to become codependent on them. The same with friends—all my friends are not in the same state as me. I think that’s why I been feeling more lonely then ever and depressed. 

Anyone feeling the same? What happened when you lost your parents? How were you able to survive?

1jfch4c,2025-03-20 06:34:38,I feel like my anxiety is going to kill me and I've been having panic attacks for days straight.,"**Long story:** Mid January I went to the ER because I abruptly woke up out of sleep with a huge sense of impending doom, rapid heart rate, insane stomach bloating and feeling like I had to poop. I wasn't sure if I was going to die or having a heart attack. I had an elevated d-dimer and TSH of 50, chest CT scan revealed nothing, EKG showed tachycardia and possible left atrial enlargement (doctor did not seem concerned about this). 

Discharged with anxiety, the week after this visit I barely ate anything, had insomnia, and got severe depersonalization where I just did not feel real anymore. Fuzzy head, nausea, I just could not function properly. I have always had episodes of panic and anxiety, but nothing this severe. I was prescribed levothyroxine for my hypothyroidism (I stopped taking it and this ER visit prompted me to re take it). 

This experience with panic attacks spurred me to seek a therapist and since then I've been battling with just a heightened sense of anxiety and doom. I started developing a deep depression and nocturnal panic attacks became more frequent. Several nights I would wake up feeling like I was dying, but I tried to focus on my symptoms and calm myself down. However, this has created a situation during the day where I felt sleepy, extreme anxiety, and a fear of going anywhere really on my own because I am afraid of dying.

Last Friday, I had a severe wave of panic again with a rapid heart rate. Again, I thought I was going to die but I tried to work through it. However, it just felt like those feelings of panic became...prolonged. The next day, I tried waking up and going about my day, and I just got this sense that something was off. I went to the ER again, this time with chest pain, dizziness, and sense of doom as my symptoms. I had a mental breakdown there. My EKG again said possible left atrial enlargement again but my heart rate was fine and my labs came back normal (slightly low WBC, high protein). A therapist came and spoke with me and we agreed to inpatient therapy, however, after they took away all my belongings I started to panic even more and decided it wasn't for me. 

Sense that visit, I cannot relax. I feel like death is on my horizon. I will admit that this feels like the first time I am coming to terms with my mortality and it's scaring the hell out of me and making me super sad. I love life, and I want to live it, but I am stuck in a mental rumination cycle where I genuinely feel like something is very off and I am going to die or drop dead at any moment. The visceral experience of panic attacks and feeling like I am dying is making me so depressed. 

My mind says ""this is it, you're going to die"" several times a day, or I have visions of my dead body on the floor. Sometimes I don't feel real or alive and feel very confused when I wake up. I fear that I am going to have a heart attack, or a brain aneurysm, or just die in my sleep. It's like there's a medical emergency looming around the corner and I can't seem to shake the feeling. Any slight sense of pain or pressure anywhere in my body I start freaking out. I have also thought that I could have a tumor that is secreting cortisol and causing waves of intense panic (I am a hypochondriac). 

I actually feel like I am going mentally insane. I don't feel safe anymore, and the past couple days I have had some more ""positive moments"" but the darkness keeps creeping in and it's really scaring me. I am so terrified to sleep because I now have a strong association with sleep and death. I am so beyond exhausted I feel like I had the flu. I scheduled an urgent appointment with my doctor, who prescribed me meds for bloating and an antihistamine for sleeping and anxiety, but I can't bring myself to take them because I'm afraid I will have an allergic reaction or it will make it worse. 

I sought urgent mental health care today and learned some techniques to calm down but I still just have this anxious feeling I can't shake and I keep wanting to go to the ER to feel safe, but I also want to avoid it also because it's triggering me. 

FYI-I recently moved to a rural area where there is a lack of medical care and I have been feeling very isolated, I have to drive 20 minutes to the nearest hospital. More anxiety :) 

Any advice or thoughts would be so appreciated as I am constantly living on edge and genuinely feel like I'm losing my mind and that the stress of all of this will actually kill me. Does this sound like just anxiety? Could there be something medically wrong with me that is making me feel this way? Am I just making myself so sick with the thought of my own mortality?

So my mom had blood work done and her WBC was 22. We thought maybe it’s a fluke, she got retested two weeks after and now it’s 37. And all her markers are up for white blood cells.

I’m positively devastated and my OCD and anxiety is flaring so bad- I can’t stop googling even though I know it’s bad. And I can’t stop blaming myself- thinking it’s God punishing me for needing my mom so much and having to move home as an adult for my mental health and now she’s going to be taken from me. Or that I didn’t appreciate her enough.

My therapist says I need to accept the possibility that people can get sick and die- and it’s not like I don’t understand that or don’t rationalize that. She tells me I can’t control my mom’s health and the course of life and I KNOW, god I know.

But my heart is broken and not having control to fix this and the idea of losing her and watching her get ill makes me want to curl up in a ball and disappear. 

I’m dying inside. I feel like I can’t breathe or think. 

Like normally my OCD and anxiety stuff is health stuff that is really irrational or even if it happened I’d be okay. And I’ve been doing so good with ERP, but the doctor throwing out leukemia and her results and my mom crying and being devastated. How am I suppose to cope with that reality, to accept that reality- that I could lose her? How I suppose to survive that?

She’s my best friend, my biggest comfort, my greatest
Joy and the most incredible mom in the world. My dad isn’t really a good person and my brother and I used to be close but his fiance doesn’t like me very much. So I feel like I have no one to turn too and like my life will just shatter and never recover if she dies. 

And I’m mad at my therapist for being like you have to accept bad things can happen- I know that for the love of god I know that. But it doesn’t mean that it’s not absolutely devastating and it shouldn’t be I just have to sit there and accept it. I just don’t know what to do.

1jforqa,2025-03-20 19:21:45,I'm going through immense suffering and people are laughing at me.,"I’m exhausted. Every day, I wake up and go to the hospital. I’ve seen doctors from almost every department, and yet, every single one tells me it’s just anxiety. I panic over the smallest things—like a tiny scratch—convinced it will turn into something serious. No matter how irrational it seems, I can’t stop myself from rushing to the hospital. Today, the staff even laughed at me because I’m there so often. I felt like a clown.

Meanwhile, I see people my age enjoying life—riding bikes with their partners, hanging out with friends—while I waste my time and my parents’ money on hospital visits. My biggest fear right now? That my penis is permanently damaged due to extreme masturbation—10 to 20 times a day for the past 10 years. I’ve had erectile dysfunction since 2022, and I suspect I have Peyronie’s disease, even though multiple urologists ruled it out. They say my penis looks normal, but how can they be sure without proper tests like a Penile Doppler Test? I’ve also been experiencing extreme numbness and discoloration in one part of my penis, yet doctors keep saying it’s okay. Are they being dismissive just because they assume my anxiety is making me imagine things? Do they have some kind of preconceived notion or prejudice against me—that I’m just an anxious, paranoid person and not worth taking seriously?

But where did this anxiety even start? Is it genetic? My father was always an anxious person—stressing over things others wouldn’t. He used to hit me almost every day until the 9th or 10th grade. I couldn’t fight back. As I grew older, I became toxic too. I started taking out my anger on my mother. The cycle of abuse continued until one day, I cut off contact with my father. He stopped abusing me, but I couldn’t stop myself from physically harming my mother. It became a part of our daily lives, and I know that’s not normal.

The worst part? Outside my home, I’m a completely different person. I don’t bully anyone. I don’t get into fights. But the moment I step inside, I become someone else. I hate it.

Sometimes, I feel like ending my life. But I don’t want to die. I still believe I can turn things around. I just don’t know how. I want to be loved. I want to be a good person. I want to be happy.

The happiest time in my life? When I was dating my ex. That was the first time I truly fell in love. I’ve been in relationships before, but this was different. I felt so joyful, so alive. And strangely, that was the period when I masturbated the least. My lust disappeared. I respected her so much that I couldn’t even think of her sexually, especially in the beginning. It felt like divine love—love without lust. I was obsessed with her, ready to do anything for her. But in the end, she ruined me. She cheated on me too.

So, what is it? Can love heal me? Or is it something I have to fix on my own? Am I like this because I’ve spent years stuck inside my room with no social life? I didn’t go to a regular college. After high school, I just stayed at home. Could that be the reason my mental health is so bad? Would having more sexual experiences help?

I don’t know what to do. I believe in God. I pray all the time, asking for relief, for happiness, for peace. But I’m still suffering. I just want to sit by the beach, watch the sunset, feel the breeze, and relax. But my mind won’t let me.

Even as I write this, my anxiety is telling me something terrible is about to happen. That I’ll get diagnosed with some awful disease. That my worst fears will come true. And if that happens, what will I do? Cry? Give up? Live in misery forever?

I don’t know. But I do know I need to change. I need to save myself. I just don’t know where to start.

1jegvyk,2025-03-19 03:46:17,I’m having a lot of scary symptoms,"Has anyone else had neurological symptoms like this? A lot of them line up with brain tumour symptoms and that scares the hell out of me :( 

In summer 2023 I had a few week period where I felt tingly all over different parts of my body and my limbs were going to sleep a lot. I had a lot of numbness and joint pain all over my body. I had a blood test and my ferritin levels were low and b12 was borderline low based on the labs range and the doctor told me I could take supplements. I’ve taken iron supplements and b12 off and on and the eat a much healthier diet and the initial flare up went away on its own 

Starting around December 2023 I get intermittent headaches that feel like they’re behind my eyes and on the right side of my head. Sometimes they’re worse in the morning. For the last year I’ve had tinnitus which sounds like a flash bang in a movie. Maybe 15 seconds of loud ringing that tapers off. When I listen to something on a phone speaker I get an intense fluttering in my right ear that’s kind of painful. This sensation has worsened. 

This past week the tingling/limbs falling asleep/joint pain everywhere has come back and I feel like I see “migraine lights” sometimes. I get jabbing pains behind my eyes and feel sensitive to light. 
A few months ago I had a comprehensive eye test where they looked behind my eyes and did every test they could and my eyes were  completely fine.

Also this week I feel very lightheaded. Almost like I have low blood sugar and haven’t eaten in a long time but I’ve been eating regularly. I feel almost jittery and like I’m not breathing properly. I walk a short distance and get super lightheaded. 

I have a small lump on my calf that’s been there for a couple years and while it doesn’t hurt to touch, I’ve been getting pain around it recently, almost like cramps. 

This is all happening while I’m in the process of getting diagnosed with colitis. 

I’m going to go to the doctor but in the mean time I’m panicking and I feel like I’ve let this go on too long without following up.

1jep2s6,2025-03-19 10:32:29,What is your experience with panic attacks and what are your symptoms? How did you figure out that it wasn’t something life-threatening?," TW: death, medical trauma and substance trauma

(21F) I apologize about how long this is going to be. I personally feel that to learn about something, I need to know the whole picture. I’m sure there are some of you with similar stories or experiences. And I’m sure there will be questions lol.

current medical conditions: PSVT, severe panic disorder, GAD, chronic depression, PTSD, ADHD-primarily inattentive, severe impulsivity, delayed sleep phase disorder, abnormal REM sleep, eosinophilic esophagitis, severe GERD

I was diagnosed with GAD, depression and PTSD when I was 12, which I developed due to my dad going into respiratory arrest when I was 9. He survived but it scarred me forever and have been dealing with it ever since. Had many issues in school, never went, was always depressed and anxious and barely graduated (COVID saved my ass though). Literally missed 100 days of my freshman year due to depression and anxiety and my sleep disorders.

Fast forward to 18, my dad ended up passing away in 2022 from multi organ failure following a heart attack (was suspected v-fib and/or STEMI, but he also had congestive heart failure, both types of diabetes, severe asthma, and a bunch of other conditions). I had a very bad reaction to synthetic THC about a year later that put me in the hospital, where I had to get my heart stopped twice. I have suspected my panic attacks are a combination of PSVT (have been diagnosed), somatic symptom disorder, and cardiophobia (which I developed after my dad died). 

I never really got panic attacks before my dad died, but after that and my reaction to synthetic THC, it has been HORRIBLE. At the beginning I used to get panic attacks mainly during the day, during school, work, while driving, with friends, etc.. but as it has progressed, I’ve started to have them mainly in my sleep and after I eat. I’ve been to the hospital a total of 17 times since 2022, 4 ambulances, with at-least 13 of those being just for panic attacks. 

I’ve literally had dreams about having strokes. At one point I basically had a pulse-ox glued to my finger 24/7 because I didn’t like that my heart rate jumped so high when I stood up. I thought I had POTS for a week and convinced myself I was going to be bedridden forever after I almost passed out once time when standing up. I actually called 911 one time for a panic attack after my HR jumped to 190 when walking up the stairs, and the paramedic noticed I had a pulse-ox on, to which he ripped it off my finger and threw it across the room and it broke. He told me to stop using it because constantly checking it was only going to make my anxiety worse. His reaction may have been a little overkill but I realized how much it was contributing once I stopped using it. Huge thanks to that paramedic, whoever you are.

These are some of the symptoms I will wake up with, or what I usually have when a panic attack comes on:

*racing heart (not sure if due to my PSVT)
*trouble breathing
*weird feeling in my body, maybe impending doom
*hot flashes
*dizziness
*one side of head gets cold or hot (alternates)
*blood pools in fingers/feels very hot
*tingling in whole body, one side of head, one side of body, usually changes each time
*feel like passing out, most of the time never do
*chest pain (only sometimes)
*sometimes get delirious
*blood pressure probably rises (I can feel it)
*always feel like I’m dying
*sometimes my adrenaline is so overactive that my body feels like it’s convulsing. I’ve had it happen multiple times in an ambulance but also at home as well

I usually wake up with a few of these symptoms, always with heart racing but the other symptoms always change. I can’t take naps without waking up feeling like this. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and experience these (whether I had a nightmare or not). I also will have some of these after I eat, which may be due to just eating large meals but I’ve also wondered if feeling it every single time is normal. 

Usually to calm myself down, I have to be around someone and talk to them/have them talk to me, watch youtube or something to occupy my brain, have them hold my hand really tight and try to distract me while my symptoms start to subside and the adrenaline kicks in. I usually am violently shaking towards the end of the panic attack, which used to scare me, but I have now learned that for me, that is a signal it is going to stop soon. I just wait for it to go away. Worst case scenario, I will take a hydroxyzine, which helps so much but it just makes me exhausted the next day.

My mom has also told me that everytime I have a panic attack, I’m always telling her “this one feels different” and trying to convince her she needs to call 911. I am aware that I am doing it but it feels justified during the panic attack because I am worried something is genuinely wrong. I’ve always been worried to ignore what is going on, incase it is something life threatening and then I die because of it.

I have also had the following tests done (because of my panic attacks):

*cardiac echo (no structural abnormalities)
*multiple MRIs on head (no tissue or nerve abnormalities) 
*EEG for brain (no electrical abnormalities)
*CT angiogram (after synthetic THC reaction to rule out blood clot), CT abdominal and CT brain (this one was after a car accident but I was still experiencing severe panic, ended up having a concussion)
*worn multiple holter monitors (Zio patch helped me get diagnosed with PSVT)
*EKGs (always sinus tach)
*CMP, BMP, thyroid, adrenal glands bloodwork (all came back fine multiple times)
*troponin and d-dimer multiple times at hospital (d-dimer was elevated different times but suspected due to just trauma and not blood clot. there could be a number of reasons)
*many chest x-rays (all fine except one time when I had pleurisy from a sickness, but it went away)
*3 sleep studies (just had one recently to see if they could catch my panic attacks while sleeping)

So basically I’ve seen sleep medicine, neurology, cardiology, general PCP and psychiatry for everything related to my panic attacks. I was going to see rheumatology at one point but I don’t remember why I didn’t (probably missed the appointment or something).

So far, the only diagnoses that have come out of this (post-2022, my dad dying and the reaction to synthetic THC) have been panic disorder and PSVT (which took 2 years to get diagnosed due to drs shrugging it off). I have heard of somatic symptom disorder as well but never been officially diagnosed. I also recently learned of Roemheld’s syndrome, which is basically when cardiac symptoms are triggered after GI disturbances, but it’s not a condition and more a group of symptoms. Although it’s fairly unrecognized and most of the time gets passed off as anxiety. Thinking about bringing it up to my GI doc soon since I will need to get another scope for my Eosinophilic Esophagitis (could also be contributing to my anxiety, been diagnosed since I was 15). 

The cardiophobia, which I didn’t realize even had a name, mostly explains what I am usually worried about when having a panic attack. Especially when they come out of nowhere and I haven’t experienced a conscious trigger. Although it may be subconscious as well. I read somewhere that if you’ve had a loved one die, you’re more likely to develop panic attacks that have symptoms similar to what they died from. So in my case, a lot of my symptoms feel cardiac related, even though electrically (besides the PSVT) and structurally everything is fine. 

I’ve had people try to tell me I’m a hypochondriac and that I’m just chasing the labels, but that doesn’t really make sense when they can actively and visually see something is going on with me. That being said, I do see myself being hypersensitive to any weird bodily sensations and automatically thinking the worst. And it doesn’t help that I constantly sleep like shit due to my sleeping disorders, which probably is just making it worse.

For context, I am currently on 100mg of Zoloft 1x day and 25mg Hydroxyzine as needed for panic attacks. I do not take any heart meds for my PSVT because my cardiologist did not recommend it unless my symptoms are so severe that I can’t function. Thankfully PSVT is not super dangerous like A-fib and he said it usually goes away as you age. He does suspect it is triggered by my panic attacks though. I linked my experience with Zoloft below that I explained to someone else:

I have gotten to the point where I am able to function and control my panic attacks most of the time, but when they happen, it still freaks me out just as bad as it has every other time. I guess that’s just part of living with the disorder. I have high heart rate notifications turned off on my apple watch, don’t use a pulse ox anymore, have been drinking more water. Once I get my ADHD and time management under control, I plan to start exercising and eating better (easier said than done though). I also recently started CBT which I know can help treat a lot of the conditions I struggle with, so I’m hoping it will help me manage those more efficiently too. Especially since I want to go to medical school and specialize in neurology… lmao. I guess it shows. Definitely need to get this under control.

Just wanted to share my story and was curious if anyone has had similar experiences and what your story is. I have found it helps me to hear other perspectives and ways that people have gone through these types of things.

(21F) I apologize about how long this is going to be. I personally feel that to learn about something, I need to know the whole picture. I’m sure there are some of you with similar stories or experiences. And I’m sure there will be questions lol.

current medical conditions: PSVT, severe panic disorder, GAD, chronic depression, PTSD, ADHD-primarily inattentive, severe impulsivity, delayed sleep phase disorder, abnormal REM sleep, eosinophilic esophagitis, severe GERD

I was diagnosed with GAD, depression and PTSD when I was 12, which I developed due to my dad going into respiratory arrest when I was 9. He survived but it scarred me forever and have been dealing with it ever since. Had many issues in school, never went, was always depressed and anxious and barely graduated (COVID saved my ass though). Literally missed 100 days of my freshman year due to depression and anxiety and my sleep disorders.

Fast forward to 18, my dad ended up passing away in 2022 from multi organ failure following a heart attack (was suspected v-fib and/or STEMI, but he also had congestive heart failure, both types of diabetes, severe asthma, and a bunch of other conditions). I had a very bad reaction to synthetic THC about a year later that put me in the hospital, where I had to get my heart stopped twice. I have suspected my panic attacks are a combination of PSVT (have been diagnosed), somatic symptom disorder, and cardiophobia (which I developed after my dad died). 

I never really got panic attacks before my dad died, but after that and my reaction to synthetic THC, it has been HORRIBLE. At the beginning I used to get panic attacks mainly during the day, during school, work, while driving, with friends, etc.. but as it has progressed, I’ve started to have them mainly in my sleep and after I eat. I’ve been to the hospital a total of 17 times since 2022, 4 ambulances, with at-least 13 of those being just for panic attacks. 

I’ve literally had dreams about having strokes. At one point I basically had a pulse-ox glued to my finger 24/7 because I didn’t like that my heart rate jumped so high when I stood up. I thought I had POTS for a week and convinced myself I was going to be bedridden forever after I almost passed out once time when standing up. I actually called 911 one time for a panic attack after my HR jumped to 190 when walking up the stairs, and the paramedic noticed I had a pulse-ox on, to which he ripped it off my finger and threw it across the room and it broke. He told me to stop using it because constantly checking it was only going to make my anxiety worse. His reaction may have been a little overkill but I realized how much it was contributing once I stopped using it. Huge thanks to that paramedic, whoever you are.

These are some of the symptoms I will wake up with, or what I usually have when a panic attack comes on:

*racing heart (not sure if due to my PSVT)
*trouble breathing
*weird feeling in my body, maybe impending doom
*hot flashes
*dizziness
*one side of head gets cold or hot (alternates)
*blood pools in fingers/feels very hot
*tingling in whole body, one side of head, one side of body, usually changes each time
*feel like passing out, most of the time never do
*chest pain (only sometimes)
*sometimes get delirious
*blood pressure probably rises (I can feel it)
*always feel like I’m dying
*sometimes my adrenaline is so overactive that my body feels like it’s convulsing. I’ve had it happen multiple times in an ambulance but also at home as well

I usually wake up with a few of these symptoms, always with heart racing but the other symptoms always change. I can’t take naps without waking up feeling like this. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and experience these (whether I had a nightmare or not). I also will have some of these after I eat, which may be due to just eating large meals but I’ve also wondered if feeling it every single time is normal.

1je3bd4,2025-03-18 18:02:56,Cancelled a job interview today.,"EDIT: A day later. Yesterday was probably one of the worst days of my life. After posting this I spent literally the entire rest of the day swapping between anxiety attacks and just bawling my eyes out. I had to go to work today and had to keep popping to the toilets to cry, didn't speak a word to anyone. My Mum keeps trying to talk to me but I keep pushing her away. I have eaten anything besides some snacks I had lying around. I worry this was yet another big regret that I'll hold against myself forever, I worry this might have been my only chance. But it also made me realise that it wouldn't have mattered, I'm deeply unhappy with myself, my body, my mind, my life, but I never would have been able to take this job because of the responsibilities I have. Meaning I just don't think I'll ever be happy, I don't get to be. Hoping maybe in a couple of days I'll be able to go back to faking the happiness, maybe even feel ""ok"" again. But I truly think this has opened my eyes and proven to me that I'm just... not ever going to have the life I want. I'm going to grow old and miserable, hate every job I have, and I'll die quickly probably. Just like my dad. He'd be so disappointed.

Feel like the worst person on the planet.

It wasn't a dream job really, it sort of was but it wasn't permanent, it was a zero hour contract, and that worried me a lot. It was definitely a dream job in the sense it was what I want to do, I think, but I have so many fears around having to take over my parent's mortgage, sick pay, idk. It didn't feel right, I don't think I would have taken the job even if they had offered it to me.

I woke up tired, felt sick all morning, had a massive panic attack and then couldn't stop crying. I'm still crying. So I cancelled. And I just, I feel like I made a stupid mistake, let the anxiety win. I'm worried if one day they have a more permanent role going that this will be held against me. I've been looking for a job in this organisation for a long time, this was the first time one came up. I felt pretty excited about it at first.

It wasn't perfect but I've also been after the opportunity to have less hours bcus I need to work on my health and the house and my family. But I have more fear than love for my life I guess, I'm too scared to take any sort of career break bcus I might need to pay all the bills one day. But I can see my life just washing away, spend all the time working, missing out on travel and finding myself and living. Even just missing out on all the books and games and tv shows I haven't had the time to start yet. I don't enjoy living and I think a career break would help but I can't do it. I don't get to have that.

I have a job, and I hate it really, but I like the people and the managers are nice and it's safe. But it causes me daily anxiety anyway, I hate being there, I hate what I do, it's only got worse over the past few years.

Idk what this is. Pointless but... idk. I just feel so stupid and unhappy and I wanted to put that out somewhere so it's not just in my head. I have no idea how I'm supposed to go into work tomorrow and just be fine after this. I'm so utterly miserable and now I've just denied myself the chance to maybe fix that. I really can't stop crying. 

I hope one day I can get that break I need, preferably before I have a heart attack or something. Although... at least maybe I could stop working for a while with that.

Meaning I just don't think I'll ever be happy, I don't get to be. Hoping maybe in a couple of days I'll be able to go back to faking the happiness, maybe even feel ""ok"" again. But I truly think this has opened my eyes and proven to me that I'm just... not ever going to have the life I want. I'm going to grow old and miserable, hate every job I have, and I'll die quickly probably. Just like my dad. He'd be so disappointed.

Feel like the worst person on the planet.

It wasn't a dream job really, it sort of was but it wasn't permanent, it was a zero hour contract, and that worried me a lot. It was definitely a dream job in the sense it was what I want to do, I think, but I have so many fears around having to take over my parent's mortgage, sick pay, idk. It didn't feel right, I don't think I would have taken the job even if they had offered it to me.

I woke up tired, felt sick all morning, had a massive panic attack and then couldn't stop crying. I'm still crying. So I cancelled. And I just, I feel like I made a stupid mistake, let the anxiety win. I'm worried if one day they have a more permanent role going that this will be held against me. I've been looking for a job in this organisation for a long time, this was the first time one came up. I felt pretty excited about it at first.

It wasn't perfect but I've also been after the opportunity to have less hours bcus I need to work on my health and the house and my family. But I have more fear than love for my life I guess, I'm too scared to take any sort of career break bcus I might need to pay all the bills one day. But I can see my life just washing away, spend all the time working, missing out on travel and finding myself and living. Even just missing out on all the books and games and tv shows I haven't had the time to start yet. I don't enjoy living and I think a career break would help but I can't do it. I don't get to have that.

I have a job, and I hate it really, but I like the people and the managers are nice and it's safe. But it causes me daily anxiety anyway, I hate being there, I hate what I do, it's only got worse over the past few years.

Idk what this is. Pointless but... idk. I just feel so stupid and unhappy and I wanted to put that out somewhere so it's not just in my head. I have no idea how I'm supposed to go into work tomorrow and just be fine after this. I'm so utterly miserable and now I've just denied myself the chance to maybe fix that. I really can't stop crying. 

I hope one day I can get that break I need, preferably before I have a heart attack or something. Although... at least maybe I could stop working for a while with that.

1jgpevp,2025-03-22 01:35:13,Had to Cancel Seeing Husband Overseas,"Long story short, my husband has been overseas for about 6 months. I had plans to go see him this morning. Well, my anxiety got in the way, MAJORLY. Last night I could not sleep, which eventually kept me up for about 24-27ish hours. I dozed off a couple times, likely sleeping a total of about 2 hours. 

(This may sound silly, but last summer we went to Europe for the first time and I think I got traumatized by my first major time change, I’m a bit of a hypochondriac, so not getting enough sleep has started to scare me.)


My mom picks me up, takes me to the airport, but I can’t get out. She tries to encourage me, my husband calls for encouragement (blessed, he doesn’t get upset with me or mad), I try to encourage myself. But the idea that I had already been up for 24 hours + had a 15 hour flight alone..my thoughts were racing. 

All night I had been having other physical symptoms of anxiety/panic and they hadn’t really stopped. I ended up not boarding my flight. 


I’m SO disappointed. Not in the fact that I didn’t go, but in the fact that I think the way I think and that it gets in the way of so many things. I do not think I would’ve had a good flight or day once I landed because of the anxiety and sleep and time change added on with such the long flight. I just am not sure I’m in the right headspace for that right now. 

There is a possibility of me flying in next week with my in laws, but even so, I’m not sure I feel comfortable.

1jf7ym3,2025-03-20 03:12:06,NOT USUAL steps to overcome anxiety,"Well, if you opened this post it means that you are probably in the situation i was a couple of months ago and i completely understand you, believe me. First you started feeling anxious, then you started having physical symptoms and you googled them and freaked out thinking it was a mortal illness. Those symptoms seem to never stop and you have entered in the vicious circle of anxiety, so welcome. I started using reddit to get some comfort from other ones in my situation and it was really good for me. I didn’t totally defeat anxiety yet but i’m improving as i never thought i would. So here are some steps that i followed in order to beat this shit. 

1- Go to a psychiatrist: Just talk to the doctor with no filter at all, tell him or her everything that you are feeling, the symptoms and tell him that you don’t completely understand why you are feeling this way.

2- TAKE THE MEDICATION: If you need to get a higher dose than the one the doctor recommended just do it and tell him that on your next appointment. Remember medication is an instrument, USE IT. 

3- Therapy is optional: I go to therapy once a week apart from my monthly appointment with my psychiatrist. I can tell you from my experience it didn’t work that much, i go for fun and to get some things out. But don’t expect your therapist to get your worries and symptoms out of you, from my experience it doesn’t work. 

4- Masturbate as much as you can: First not common advice, usually when i’m nervous i instantly go to the bathroom and masturbate as if there was no tomorrow. Believe me it clears your mind at least for a bit. 

5- If you want to google, do it: The thing is at certain point you’ll get tired of googling and thinking you have cancer or ALS because you will always visit the same sites, the addiction of searching for symptoms goes away by itself. Don’t care about your symptoms, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR apart from doing anual medical tests (blood work, urine, cardiac tests). If in your anual encounter with the doctor you want to mention your symptoms do it, he’ll tell you its nothing to be worried about. 

6- Drink alcohol: Yeah that’s right, get drunk now and then. I mean try not to get an overdose but what alcohol does to meds its basically improve the effects so yeah, for me it worked. Then you will feel less worried with time and you won’t even need alcohol anymore. 

7- Exercise three times a week: Basically a common advice. Try to got to the gym and practice some team sports with your friends, or without them and get some new friends. But be a social person, no matter what you are feeling inside. 

8- LOOK AROUND YOU: That’s it, go for a walk in the city and realize the people are not walking around with tumours and neurological problems everywhere. It won’t happen to you either. Your mind is testing you. 

Finally i’ll tell you that you are healthy, you are an existing being in an infinite universe and life deserves to be lived. You are not alone, you are made of the same material as stars and don’t fear death because you are young and you won’t die now. Live a long and happy life and always know that when the moment comes you’ll just go to a better place and you’ll do whathever you want. I know from personal experiences and family experiences that life is just part of the journey. You’ll get to know the universe one day but now you are here for a reason so focus on that and don’t be a pussy. Greetings to all.

I started using reddit to get some comfort from other ones in my situation and it was really good for me. I didn’t totally defeat anxiety yet but i’m improving as i never thought i would. So here are some steps that i followed in order to beat this shit. 

1- Go to a psychiatrist: Just talk to the doctor with no filter at all, tell him or her everything that you are feeling, the symptoms and tell him that you don’t completely understand why you are feeling this way.

2- TAKE THE MEDICATION: If you need to get a higher dose than the one the doctor recommended just do it and tell him that on your next appointment. Remember medication is an instrument, USE IT. 

3- Therapy is optional: I go to therapy once a week apart from my monthly appointment with my psychiatrist. I can tell you from my experience it didn’t work that much, i go for fun and to get some things out. But don’t expect your therapist to get your worries and symptoms out of you, from my experience it doesn’t work. 

4- Masturbate as much as you can: First not common advice, usually when i’m nervous i instantly go to the bathroom and masturbate as if there was no tomorrow. Believe me it clears your mind at least for a bit. 

5- If you want to google, do it: The thing is at certain point you’ll get tired of googling and thinking you have cancer or ALS because you will always visit the same sites, the addiction of searching for symptoms goes away by itself. Don’t care about your symptoms, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR apart from doing anual medical tests (blood work, urine, cardiac tests). If in your anual encounter with the doctor you want to mention your symptoms do it, he’ll tell you its nothing to be worried about. 

6- Drink alcohol: Yeah that’s right, get drunk now and then. I mean try not to get an overdose but what alcohol does to meds its basically improve the effects so yeah, for me it worked. Then you will feel less worried with time and you won’t even need alcohol anymore. 

7- Exercise three times a week: Basically a common advice. Try to got to the gym and practice some team sports with your friends, or without them and get some new friends. But be a social person, no matter what you are feeling inside. 

8- LOOK AROUND YOU: That’s it, go for a walk in the city and realize the people are not walking around with tumours and neurological problems everywhere. It won’t happen to you either. Your mind is testing you. 

Finally i’ll tell you that you are healthy, you are an existing being in an infinite universe and life deserves to be lived. You are not alone, you are made of the same material as stars and don’t fear death because you are young and you won’t die now. Live a long and happy life and always know that when the moment comes you’ll just go to a better place and you’ll do whathever you want. I know from personal experiences and family experiences that life is just part of the journey. You’ll get to know the universe one day but now you are here for a reason so focus on that and don’t be a pussy. Greetings to all.

Reddit can feel like the only place to vent because it’s anonymous, but let’s be real—people here are *cruel*. Cold. Dismissive.  
It’s easy to forget there are actual human beings behind the screen, but it feels even easier for people to forget *you’re* a real human when you post.

You open up about your worst thoughts, just hoping for someone to say, “Hey, I’ve been there too”... and instead you get hit with:

* “Seek help.”
* “Why would you even post this?”
* “You sound like a burden.”
* Or worse—downvotes into oblivion, like your feelings don’t matter at all.

And that messes you up more. Makes you wonder if you *are* too much. If maybe the world really is as cold as it feels.

But you’re not. You’re just trying to survive. Trying to feel seen somewhere, *anywhere*.

1jfygwi,2025-03-21 02:17:24,Why are people so judgemental about not having hobbies,"People get such a superiority complex when they talk about their hobbies and then when you tell them you don’t really do anything besides survive, they look down on you.

Anything I enjoy in my free time (watching TV/movies, listening to music) isn’t considered a hobby. I do like to read books and go on holiday but that isn’t considered as respectable as “travelling”.

If someone doesn’t have a “hobby”, it’s probably because they’re doing their best just to stay alive. I get literally no joy out of anything anymore, no I’m not suddenly going to start painting or horse riding or whatever the fuck that I have absolutely no talent at just to please society.

If someone doesn’t have a “hobby”, it’s probably because they’re doing their best just to stay alive. I get literally no joy out of anything anymore, no I’m not suddenly going to start painting or horse riding or whatever the fuck that I have absolutely no talent at just to please society.

And oh my god it feels so good to get that over with. Who knew that doing something so simple that I was too depressed to do for months would be so rewarding? I'm hoping this will be the first of many wins and that I won't stop here.

1jcsz50,2025-03-17 01:05:32,Having trouble supporting my suicidal friend because I kind of agree with them,"I do not struggle with mental health, however my partner struggles with it severely. They struggle with depression and self-harm. They have many things that make life difficult including a traumatic past with passed parents, addiction, homelessness and abandonment; chronic exhaustion, frequent pain, few friends, struggling to make ends meet, job they hate, doesn't like how they look, etc. They definitely have times when there's things they look forward to and they enjoy life, but they frequently have depressive episodes and there's many problems they worry about that don't really have a solution, and it brings them a lot of despair and hopelessness (ex. State of the world, financial situation, getting older). Oftentimes when they are in a depressive state, they will tell me that they are tired of fighting and it's not worth it anymore. I used to be more optimistic and tried to remind/show them things that can help bring joy and can get better, but more recently I have begun to be more sympathetic and find myself somewhat agreeing that it doesn't feel worth it for them. Personally I feel my life is worth living, but their life is so difficult that it makes me wonder if it really is worth it for them. Especially as their body does not seem to be in very good condition and they often have health problems, and I fear it won't be that long until they begin to experience chronic pain and other issues that will debilitate them. They already don't do well mentally if they stay at home much or are alone or can't move their body well, so I fear that if they have more pain or other health issues their quality of life will become so bad it will be torture.

If quality of life becomes that bad, what is the point of trying to continue living? I know the logic of finding small things to enjoy and hoping for things to improve, but in the case where your pain/issues are so severe that you can't even do the things that would improve your mental health or make you feel better, and you know things will continue to get worse over time, I don't really get how it's worth it. I tend to be very logical and cost/benefit-minded, so I can't help but think about it from a ""is the benefit worth the effort"" mindset, and the answer I keep coming to is no, it's not worth it. If someone is ill and near the end of their life, then ending it early is more accepted as people accept that enduring the pain for a little longer just for the sake of being alive isn't worth it, so I don't understand how the same logic doesn't hold just because someone theoretically has many more years left and isn't about to die. Even if there still are some happy moments in-between, if someone tells me that the happy bits aren't worth all the suffering and they're tired of fighting, how can I tell them that they should continue to fight and suffer anyways? They just told me it isn't worth it, and if they've decided their suffering is too great, who am I to try to convince them to continue going through hell?

Anyways, I don't actually want them to die and I have never said any of this to them; I still do my best to support them and help them to find reasons to live.

1jeev5z,2025-03-19 02:22:10,The addiction no one talks about....Why we can’t stop craving approval,"why do we need other people to approve of us so badly? Even when we know we should validate ourselves, there’s still that itch to hear, “You’re doing great,” or “I see you, I value you.” And when we don’t get it? That doubt creeps in.

It’s wild when you think about it. Logically, we know external validation shouldn’t define us. But psychologically? We’re wired to seek it. Humans are social creatures..our brains are literally designed to seek approval because, for most of human history, survival depended on being accepted by the group. Feeling excluded? That wasn’t just rejection; that was a death sentence back in the day. So yeah, this runs deep.

But here’s where it gets tricky. When you rely too much on external validation, you give other people control over how you feel about yourself. If they praise you, you’re on top of the world. If they don’t, suddenly you’re doubting everything. That’s a dangerous cycle because you end up chasing approval rather than building real self-worth.

Self-validation, on the other hand, is like an internal muscle..you have to strengthen it over time. It’s about being able to say, “I’m proud of myself,” or “I trust my own judgment,” without needing a round of applause to confirm it.

It seemed like back then there was more acceptance towards those who had mental illness. Now the “culture of care” we used to have is down the drain. When I first came out with having bipolar and depression I had friends and people around me who seemed to be supportive. Then a few years went by, I aged rapidly, I put on weight, started showing more obvious signs of depression, and became poor. Now it seems like those same people who supported me now avoid me like I’m diseased or gawk at me like I’m some kind of spectacle. 

Back in the throws of pandemic it was all “end the stigma” and “Kumbaya~ you can trust people, we want to help you” now the general consensus is “You’re on your own and no one’s coming to save you” and “Stop acting cringey and develop some social skills” or “If you’re in crisis you must be a crisis friend *blocked*”

And as a disclaimer…when I say ‘people’ I by no means am referring to everyone. I’ve had quite a few rad people reach out and check on me or even find ways to help me out. Having said that, it still doesn’t change the fact that I’m deeply hurt with how I was treated big-picture wise and by most people after my mental illness wasn’t ‘cute’ ‘fun’ or ‘quirky’ anymore. I just feel like I bought into the kindness trap, got too comfortable around people, then everyone turned their backs on me. I feel hurt, disgusted, betrayed, and most of all I felt abandoned.

1jedkj3,2025-03-19 01:29:40,"i dont want this life anymore. (tw: sh, od, ed)","I feel so selfish for even writing this because I know from a regular perspective I have a relatively good life but it's so much more than that.

I struggle with almost every aspect of life I can think of. I'm always so tired physically and mentally.
I have struggled with self harm for 4 years now and I always just go back to it now matter how hard i try to stay clean and it's exhausting. 
I always feel like the only escape is suicide but ever single time I try I fucking fail. the only person I've told just didn't believe me so what's the point anyways. 
I crave comfort because I never had it growing up and I just want to feel loved and cared for.
I hate how I look. I've always been bullied and that has only made my self esteem even worse, i feel sick looking at myself. 
I starve myself but all it does is makes me more anxious and I never see any good results no matter how hard I try. 
I can't focus on academics because I have way too much going on in my head and struggle to keep it together.
this all makes sleeping even harder and I just miss having somebkdy there and being able to feel safe. 
every night I remind myself of the girl I used to be, I could never understand how anyone could ever hurt themselves or why they'd do it, now I'm the person I once looked down upon, that little girl would never understand how she'd grow up to try her hardest just to keep herself alive every night. 
self harm is my only escape but then it just makes me feel worse at the same time as comforting me and it's horrible.
I have to force myself to feel happy so people don't notice and think I'm seeking attention but then it just makes me feel 10x worse because I know it's such a forced feeling.
my family won't let me get help.

(tw: sh, od, ed) I feel so selfish for even writing this because I know from a regular perspective I have a relatively good life but it's so much more than that.

I struggle with almost every aspect of life I can think of. I'm always so tired physically and mentally.
I have struggled with self harm for 4 years now and I always just go back to it now matter how hard i try to stay clean and it's exhausting. 
I always feel like the only escape is suicide but ever single time I try I fucking fail. the only person I've told just didn't believe me so what's the point anyways. 
I crave comfort because I never had it growing up and I just want to feel loved and cared for.
I hate how I look. I've always been bullied and that has only made my self esteem even worse, i feel sick looking at myself. 
I starve myself but all it does is makes me more anxious and I never see any good results no matter how hard I try. 
I can't focus on academics because I have way too much going on in my head and struggle to keep it together.
this all makes sleeping even harder and I just miss having somebkdy there and being able to feel safe. 
every night I remind myself of the girl I used to be, I could never understand how anyone could ever hurt themselves or why they'd do it, now I'm the person I once looked down upon, that little girl would never understand how she'd grow up to try her hardest just to keep herself alive every night. 
self harm is my only escape but then it just makes me feel worse at the same time as comforting me and it's horrible.
I have to force myself to feel happy so people don't notice and think I'm seeking attention but then it just makes me feel 10x worse because I know it's such a forced feeling.
my family won't let me get help.
I struggle to open up to people because of fear they will just judge me.

I haven't thought about suicide this much since I attempted when i was 16, but at least there was some form of hope back then. Now I realise that I either have to get used to working myself to death forever or just kill myself now. 
Surely everyone is suicidal and just pretends they're not and are too scared to do it?? How can this existence make anyone feel any other way i just don't fucking get it

when i was 16 I told my therapist that even if I do get better, i'll probably end up killing myself somewhere down the line, probably early 20's, and it's looking like I was right.","{'neg': 0.202, 'neu': 0.714, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': -0.9781}",-0.9781,Negative,3,1,"['working', 'fucking', '16', 'existence', 'killing', 'probably', 'fulltime', 'pretends', 'just', 'evening']",High-Risk

1jcd853,2025-03-16 10:03:15,I have been stealing money from and lying to my parents about med school for years and I'm going to end my life for it,"Basically the title. I have been telling my parents that I was studying in medical school for the last 4 years and my parents generously paid my rent and tuition for the first two years of school. After the first two years, I then went on a leave of absence due to severe depression, but I didn't tell my parents about it. We're Asian, so I knew they wouldn't approve since they really don't believe in mental health stuff, and I really told myself I would use the time to get my mind right, study a bit and work on and improve myself. 

Well, the furthest thing from that ended up happening these last two years. I just ended up working part time just to cover rent and some basic living expenses, but I did nothing to cure my depression, didn't study at all, and got nothing done in life. I have basically been working for a few hours a day and wasting away in bed, and have nothing to show for the last two years. However, that didn't stop me from accepting my parents' money. While I did cover rent and food, my mom still made me microwaveable meals from time to time, bought me clothes and shoes and sent me some money every now and then. They thought all of this was an investment into my future, but really I was just squandering it away and being a lazy bum.

I have been telling my parents that I was studying in medical school for the last 4 years and my parents generously paid my rent and tuition for the first two years of school. After the first two years, I then went on a leave of absence due to severe depression, but I didn't tell my parents about it. We're Asian, so I knew they wouldn't approve since they really don't believe in mental health stuff, and I really told myself I would use the time to get my mind right, study a bit and work on and improve myself. 

Well, the furthest thing from that ended up happening these last two years. I just ended up working part time just to cover rent and some basic living expenses, but I did nothing to cure my depression, didn't study at all, and got nothing done in life. I have basically been working for a few hours a day and wasting away in bed, and have nothing to show for the last two years. However, that didn't stop me from accepting my parents' money. While I did cover rent and food, my mom still made me microwaveable meals from time to time, bought me clothes and shoes and sent me some money every now and then. They thought all of this was an investment into my future, but really I was just squandering it away and being a lazy bum.

I was right six years ago. I’m exactly who I thought I was. A failure, a loser, a disappointment. Nothing’s changed. This is all I have to look forward to. A lifetime of *this*. I should’ve offed myself back then. Too bad I’m too much of a pussy to kill myself without a gun. 

Americans are so lucky. Had I been born a few miles south, I‘d be long gone by now. My family would have mourned me and moved on. Instead I’ve spent years lingering like a cancer. I’m far past my expiration date. I was supposed to die back then. I’m so tired. I just want this to be over.","{'neg': 0.18, 'neu': 0.74, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': -0.9902}",-0.9902,Negative,1,2,"['assignments', 'courses', 'knew', 'finish', 'semester', 'lifetime', 'failure', 'years', 'college', 'started']",High-Risk

I dont know if I am sane anymore or if I ever was
I might be going through a burnout. The name of what I have right now doesn't really matter. Professionals might call it different names, I call it a ""living hell"" 
And the cherry on top? I am closeted trans with a great deal of dysphoria 
Lol

My daughters, 11 and 13, just got back in contact with their dad. He lost his parental rights in 2021 due to abuse and addiction. They contacted him for the first time since then on Feb 23 because his sister/their aunt had just passed from an accidental overdose. She was his best friend and I knew he wouldn’t be with us much longer after that. I just knew in my gut that it was going to send him over the edge. 

We saw him at the viewing and at the funeral on March 2 and 3, and it was really great for all of them, despite the circumstances. March 5 I text him and told him it would be ok for him to stay in contact with our girls via phone. They talked to him multiple times a day since then. 

On March 10, just one week after his sister’s funeral, he had been using while on FaceTime with our girls. They didn’t know what they were seeing when he went into overdose. They described it to me in detail a couple days ago. On Tuesday, they both said he wasn’t answering their calls or texts. I knew he was gone, but I told myself I was overreacting. I asked them through the day if they had heard from their dad, but it was always “No”. On Wednesday, it was the same. Wednesday night before bed, my 13 yr old said that her messages were no longer delivering and asked me if we could just go check on him. I told her no, and asked her to tell me first thing in the morning if he reached out to her. 

Thursday morning she told me her messages still weren’t delivering. I called the police that morning and asked for a welfare check. They went over and the door was locked, no answer, just the dog inside barking. The landlord let them in that afternoon, and at 1:46pm a detective called me. 

We’ve spent every day over at his house, my kids wanting to grab every piece of clothes he has recently worn, just to feel like he is close to them. I have no way to help them, all I can do is sit with them and cry together. I hate addiction, I hate opiates, I hate the pain they’re going through, the pain I’m going through. I hate the people who don’t understand and who just look at him as someone who was selfish and picked the drug over his kids, I hate the disease.

Hello,

Since the first day I smoked Crack ( Two years ago), it became a daily habit. There wasn’t a build-up, it just started and kept going. I lost a lot of money and became underweight. I dropped from 66 to 46 kilograms without even realizing it at first. I was working from home, which only made things worse. Even though my job required focus and mental sharpness, I still managed to get things done. Always last minute, somehow, but done. And that’s part of what made it dangerous. I could still perform. I could still deliver. So I kept lying to myself.

What I’ve learned is that no matter how smart I think I am, Crack is the way to hell. It doesn’t care how clever you are, how much potential you have, or how much you tell yourself you’re in control. It strips you down to nothing.

I managed to stop for a few days sometimes, but once I start again, I can’t stop. Especially with the person I was hanging out with. We were living together. I was the one who smoked it first, then we smoked together the next day. After that, it was part of the routine. Day after day.

We had a lot of problems. I was paying for everything. He couldn’t stop, not even for one day. He started acting differently. Lying constantly. The only thing he cared about was Crack. He was older than me by ten years, but I ended up being the one who took care of everything. Rent, food, damage control. It became chaos. And even though I could see it clearly, I stayed. I thought I was strong enough to handle it. I thought I could carry both of us.

I tried keeping my distance. Sometimes we would stop talking, or I would pull away, but it never lasted. We kept ending up back together. Not out of love or hope, but out of habit, out of guilt, out of that strange sense of responsibility I couldn’t explain.

Eventually, I decided to leave the city. I quit my job. Left everything behind. I spent the last six months far away. During that time, I started to feel like myself again. I ate properly, slept, and gained back over 15 kilograms. I looked healthier. I felt clearer. I thought I was done with that chapter.

But earlier this month, I came back. We saw each other again. And yes, we smoked a few times.

This time, it felt different. I didn’t even get high. All I felt was anxiety. A tight chest. Physical panic. There was no pleasure in it anymore. No illusion of escape. Just a harsh reminder that this thing still had a grip on me. And the worst part is, I already suffer from depression, anxiety, and ADHD. Crack makes all of that worse. It amplifies everything I try to manage. It replaces the high with a storm.

I don’t have trouble staying away from him now. I’m not attached in the same way I used to be. But I still worry about him. I still get thoughts like, “What if something happens to him?” Even though he did unforgivable things. Even though everyone tells me he’s just using me, that he talks badly about me, that he’s only ever taken and never given. Maybe they’re right. But I don’t hate him. I don’t love him either. I feel something in between. More like grief. not even grief for him, but for who I was around him I don't know maybe GUILT. I kept trying to be someone who could hold everything together. Someone who could fix what wasn’t theirs to fix.

I’ve always been assertive. Direct. But even with that, I’ve realized something uncomfortable. I might be too good to be true. I care too much. I give too much. Even when it’s breaking me.

I’ve started looking for a new job again. It’s been two weeks now. I’m trying to rebuild slowly, and I don’t want to fall back into what it was. I want to get back the life I had before I let all of this take over. But I know that the real recovery isn’t just physical or professional. It’s inside. It’s learning how to care without erasing yourself in the process.

I don’t know exactly what I’m asking here. Maybe nothing. Maybe I just needed to write this. Maybe you’ve been there. Maybe you understand what I mean when I say that the drug isn’t even the hardest part. It’s the role you play around it. The version of yourself you become to survive it.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. I’ve been staring at this graph I made to track usage. It wasn’t supposed to be anything more than data. But now when I look at it, it feels like a journal. Like a confession. Every spike, every drop, it doesn’t just show how much I smoked. It shows when I started to disappear.

I don’t know exactly what I’m asking here. Maybe nothing. Maybe I just needed to write this. Maybe you’ve been there. Maybe you understand what I mean when I say that the drug isn’t even the hardest part. It’s the role you play around it. The version of yourself you become to survive it.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at. I’ve been staring at this graph I made to track usage. It wasn’t supposed to be anything more than data. But now when I look at it, it feels like a journal. Like a confession. Every spike, every drop, it doesn’t just show how much I smoked. It shows when I started to disappear.

Thanks for reading. I’m open to hearing whatever you want to share.","{'neg': 0.136, 'neu': 0.751, 'pos': 0.113, 'compound': -0.9819}",-0.9819,Negative,0,3,"['crack', 'smoked', 'maybe', 'kept', 'started', 'care', 'graph', 'kilograms', 'day', 'stop']",Moderate Concern

1jehx9u,2025-03-19 04:31:06,Do you think your addiction was caused by mental illness?,"I feel like a lot of addiction (if not all) can at least partially be traced back to mental illness. This also makes me think that a lot of times when people say someone has an “addictive personality” they actually just have a mental disorder (most likely ADHD).

Here are two examples that I myself can relate to and I think a lot of others as well:

1. (ADHD) ADHD is often believed to be caused by a dopamine deficiency. This causes you to constantly feel the need for something that gives you that dopamine, or at least something that fills that hole. f.e. This can lead to a drug addiction so you finally feel good and satisfied.

2. (Depression) When you’re depressed, there’s often nothing that can make you happy. This can frequently lead to you laying in bed all day doing nothing or something that makes time seem to go by faster. An easy way to get some dopamine while laying in bed on your phone is to masturbate. This can easily lead to you getting addicted to masturbating since it’s the most accessible way to make you feel a little better.

These are just examples and probably not the best. You can insert just about any addiction in those examples, I’ve just picked some that I’ve personally had some experience with and seem some other people have experienced as well.

I have ADHD, depression and social anxiety disorder. I feel like I’m constantly cycling between addictions and I’m never truly sober (the times I’ve used the least amount of things, have been the times I’m the most suicidal and feel the worst). I constantly absolutely crave for something that makes me feel even a little better, anything from drugs, to excessively masturbating, to binge eating, to getting obsessed with a tv show and watching it 10+ hours a day.

1jgyml9,2025-03-22 08:44:20,The role of choice & personal responsibility in addiction.,"When it comes to addiction, you always get treated like an ignorant asshole if you suggest “you have choices & you’re responsible for the choices you make” re: drug addiction. 
 
I’m approaching 32 now, but I spent the ages of 18-24 addicted to drugs, in & out of rehab, detox, jail, psych ward…I did all that shit, and in retrospect, I had choices and I accept responsibility for the choices I made. 

At the time I *felt* like I didn’t have a choice, because rehab indoctrinated me into believing that I had no choice, and also it was convenient for me to say “I have no choice; I have a trauma-related brain disease!” because I wanted to get high & avoid responsibility for my decision. 

I understand genuinely *feeling* powerless over addiction, but let’s be honest, we know how drugs work. We know they fuck with your mind. It’s not like I had no clue what I was signing up for when I decided to smoke a crack rock for the first time. 

That’s why I get confused when people talk about addiction as a ‘disease’ & they say it affects your neurology in such a way that ‘you feel like you need the drug to survive!!!’ 

OK sure, but you also KNOW for a fact that you DON’T need to smoke crack in order to survive. I could be high as fuck on crack & it doesn’t make me oblivious to the reality that crack-cocaine isn’t like water & it’s not actually essential for survival. 

So even if I strongly feel like I ‘need’ to buy & smoke more crack, I KNOW that I do not IN REALITY have that need. It’s just a drug-induced feeling: I feel like I ‘need’ crack only because I’ve been smoking crack, which fucks with my perception of what I need & causes me to feel like I need things that I do not, in fact, actually need. 

I knew that all along. I’m not stupid. I smoked crack on purpose. It was my choice. I chose to be a crack addict. 

Why? To get high. I loved getting high on crack. 

Why did I keep doing it despite the damage it was causing to my life? Because I was irresponsible & chose to prioritize the short-term pleasure of a crack-high over anything else that actually mattered & added fulfilment to my life. 

…I just used crack as an example, I could say the same thing for meth or benzos or alcohol or other drugs. 

TLDR — I’m sick of people assuming I’ve never been through addiction just because I don’t subscribe to the “addiction is a trauma-caused brain disease that makes you powerless over your choices” belief. It’s a choice. The feelings of powerlessness are an illusion and/or a convenient excuse to continue your addiction.

1jg2q9n,2025-03-21 05:18:44,I wrote this song about my girlfriend a week ago. She passed away from a drug overdose the same day I was supposed to come show it to her.,"It still doesn't feel real that she's gone. She was the love of my life. My best friend. My soulmate. She was my first love and highschool sweetheart. We broke up and went our separate ways, then reconnected 7 years later in our late 20's. We were together for about 3 years after reconnecting. We're both addicts and this past year has been hell for both of us, especially her. Constantly struggling to stay clean. Living on the street. Putting her through so much trauma due to almost dying to overdoses myself. Just pure chaos. I finally got clean a few months ago and am currently in a recovery house. Her birthday was on the 15th. That's the last time I saw her. I was supposed to show her this song then but we didn't have enough time for me to play it so I planned to show her the next time we saw eachother. The day we planned to meet up is the same day she was pronounced dead. I have so much guilt for the role I played in this all. Now it haunts me that I didn't show her when I had the chance on her birthday. We were supposed to get clean together and get married and live a life together. Start a band. Travel the world. Grow old together. I don't know how to cope with this pain it is absolutely unbearable. I've been through some things in my lifetime but this tops it. I lost my soulmate. I miss her so much.

I know this sub isn't for sharing music but I felt it was a good opportunity to vent about the situation and the context surrounding the song is relevent. It is horrifically sad timing to have lost the love of my life the same day I was so excited to sing this song to her. It's also unbelievablely sad given the fact that the song is literally about being by her side and supporting her until she can see her way out of the addiction she was trapped in. It all feels like the sickest joke the universe could've played on me. I've reached out to family and people I concider supports in my life. I'm still processing everything. It all just feels like the worst nightmare and I'm just waiting to wake up from it. Her name was Sierra and I adored her in every way.

The video I posted is a rough version with a few slip ups and my ukulele was out of tune. It hurts too much right now to keep playing it so this version will have to do. Please don't let the fact that I'm grieving stop y'all from giving honest criticisms of my playing or the songwriting, however harsh they may be. I'm curious what others think about my music, especially fellow musicians.

TL;DR: I wrote this song about my girlfriend who, since writing it, has passed away and never got to hear it. I'm curious what others think of it.

Here are the lyrics:

""Stop The Bleed""

You've been sitting in the dark for far too long
Eyes adjusted, spirit rusted, same sad song
Familiar voices wait to comfort you into the wrong
Way too bright when I hit the light cause you're too far gone

So I'll sit in the dark with you
For as long as you need
And I'll play this guitar for you
Until we're finally able to see

Our way out of this mess that I've created 
So many nights that I know you spent up waiting
All the time wasted, can't help but hate it
Apology belated, so I'll just save it
I ran through the muck with your love need to face it
Pushed all my luck how the fuck do I say it
That all this time wasted away and I hate it
It's too late for sorry now, so I'll just save it

But I'll sit in the dark with you
For as long as you need
And I'll play this guitar for you
Until you're finally able to breathe
Able to breathe x3

With all that's been said 
And all that's been done
You've still got my heart
You're my only one 
I'd walk a hundred miles
If it meant something to you
Do anything 
If I could just find a way to

Stop the bleed x3
You'll be able to breathe once we finally
Stop the bleed x3
I'll be able to breathe once we finally
Stop the bleed x3

1jdnbl3,2025-03-18 02:46:01,Addiction is not a chemical dependency,"
Addiction is not just a lack of will power

Addiction is not a disease in a way you've been told.

Addiction is a reality loop. A subconscious identity lock that traps people in a self re-enforcing cycle of experience. It is not about substances, it is about energy imprints that has been coded into the nervous system. Until you break the loop at its core, no amounts of therapy, rehab, or discipline will eliminate it.

The hidden truth is addiction is a self perpetuating identity pattern. The reason addiction feels inescapable is because it locks itself into the subconscious as part of an identity construct. Once an identity is installed, the brains reticular activating system works to confirm it in absolute reality. This is why people relapse. It's not the substance that pulls them back. It's the programmed identity. 

What was never told. You don't fight addiction, you erase and re write the identity framework that makes it real.

When the subconscious blue print of addiction collapses, the behaviour disappears effortlessly. 

Instead of enforcing behaviour change, you reconstruct your identity at the root level so addiction no longer belongs to the person.

You don't overcome addiction, you become someone whom addiction is no longer a possible reality.

1jhdle6,2025-03-22 23:22:36,"Social Media, Marijuana, and Video Games Are Quietly Destroying Us","Seven days ago, I quit all three—cold turkey. I'm on my third argument this week and have been trying to burn bridges for the past 24 hours. Luckily, my closest people know what I'm going through. For the most part, their response texts have been reassuring—they know this is hard, and they love me.

But I’d much rather go through this pain than the mind rot and emptiness caused by everything else. Social media, marijuana, and video games are as addictive—if not more addictive—than any hardcore drug on the illicit or legal market. I invite anyone to convince me otherwise. Social media combined with marijuana and video games creates a feedback loop that’s more addictive than any hardcore drug. Again, I invite anyone to convince me otherwise.

Granted, cocaine will cause a dependency that creates a much stronger yearning. Hard drugs like cocaine cause intense withdrawal symptoms and are tied to life challenges that often lead to drug use in the first place. But few substances are labeled as harmless and legally distributed to the masses like marijuana, social media, and video games. They are Trojan horses—quietly leading us toward a gradual but almost certain mental, spiritual, and social demise. Convince me otherwise.

The algorithms used by corporate social media and video game creators are designed to cause repeat use. They target psychological vulnerabilities, using variable rewards and dopamine hits to hook you. The goal isn’t to entertain—it’s to keep you coming back, no matter the cost to your mental health.

And this isn’t just theoretical. Nearly every troubled corner of the world has an underbelly of drug addiction fueling its problems:

**1. Syria** – The Assad regime has reportedly fueled the production and distribution of **Captagon**, an amphetamine-like drug used to keep fighters awake and aggressive.

**2. Afghanistan** – The Taliban controls the opium trade, making Afghanistan the world’s largest supplier of **heroin**. Addiction rates among Afghan civilians are devastating.

**3. Mexico** – Cartels like the **Sinaloa Cartel** and **CJNG** control the trafficking of cocaine, meth, and fentanyl, fueling violence and corruption.

**4. Colombia** – Despite efforts to eradicate coca crops, Colombia remains one of the largest producers of **cocaine**. Cartel violence and political instability remain serious issues.

**5. Russia** – The rise of **Krokodil** (desomorphine), a cheap and toxic synthetic opioid, has created a public health crisis and severe addiction problems.

**6. United States** – The **opioid crisis** has been fueled by overprescription of painkillers and the rise of fentanyl, contributing to overdose deaths and strained public health systems.

**7. West Africa** – Countries like **Guinea-Bissau** have become key transit hubs for cocaine. Drug money has infiltrated politics and fueled local addiction.

**8. Myanmar** – Myanmar is a major producer of **methamphetamine** and **opium**, with armed groups and criminal syndicates profiting from the drug trade.

**9. Venezuela** – The Venezuelan government and military have been accused of direct involvement in cocaine trafficking through the **Cartel of the Suns**, using drug money to prop up the regime.

**10. North Korea** – The regime reportedly manufactures and exports **methamphetamine** to raise foreign currency, while domestic use is rising.

Drug addiction doesn’t just cause personal destruction—it erodes entire societies. It fuels violence, corruption, and political instability, creating a cycle that’s nearly impossible to break. That’s why I believe social media, marijuana, and video games—while not physically destructive like heroin or cocaine—are just as dangerous in how they hijack human behavior and create dependency.

Some might say that even talking about drug addiction as a major societal issue is a conservative or far-right talking point. Maybe. But it’s not the fact that addiction is a problem—it’s how we frame the solution that defines the political angle. Punishment and moral judgment lean right. Harm reduction and mental health treatment lean left. But addiction itself? It’s just reality.

And honestly, even if drugs disappeared tomorrow, addiction wouldn’t vanish. People are wired to seek relief from pain and boredom—to chase dopamine and escape discomfort. If drugs were gone, that impulse would likely shift toward other outlets: gambling, social media, sex, or extreme behavior. Addiction isn’t just about the substance—it’s about the brain’s reward system.

The truth is, **our brains are flawed**. We're wired to seek easy dopamine hits and avoid discomfort. And we’re too lazy to fix it—too self-interested to create a lasting community that could prevent it. We’d rather take the short-term hit than face the hard work of building real resilience and connection.

They aren’t just harmless distractions. They are quiet enablers of a broader societal decline. And the worst part? We’re inviting them into our lives willingly. Convince me otherwise.

Now, I also can't really contribute what problem in life to what, there are too many complicated factors, but I do know since 2020 when I graduated, gradually to now, somehow I have gone from being 18 and having literally 0 problem with impulse control, easily saving several thousand dollars, to now at 22 struggling to keep my bank account with any money in it at all. My previous relationship, starting in 2020 to 2024, also was perfectly fine till about 2022/2023, when we started fighting a lot. I also had decent grades my first year in school, till dropping out of college TWICE, in 2023, gap year, and then this year again. I don't really know, it all just kinda fell apart, but is it weed, depression, relationship troubles, lack of friends and things to do, some combination is beyond me. 

But recently I have struggled to get hired anywhere, despite multiple applications and interviews, even with people who claimed to be desperate for workers, or who even claimed I was a great fit in interviews. I do have more time on my hands, am more bored, sure, but I have recently begun to do more and more drastic things to get my hands on edibles. 

First, my financial situation is easily the worst its been. I am 7 or 8k in debt, multiple toll payments, a parking ticket, college debt, credit card debt, and when I tell you I could literally care less about paying these things off, when I get my hands on 10 or 20 dollars somehow these days, it goes to weed, period. Any change for some gas to get around a bit. Normally I would buy edibles up to 3 or 4 times a week sometimes even, but I always was making at least around as much back, or more. 

Now?

In the last month or so I have

\-asked my dad for the remainder of my money, for gas, like literally 60$, that I gave to him LITERALLY for the safekeeping of MYSELF, in a moment of strength, a while ago. 80% went to edibles. 20% was for driving to them

\-asked to borrow 20$ from my grandparents for gas, and again like 3$ of that actually went to gas. Nothing crazy but still an uncharacteristic thing for me to do.

\-stolen any money hidden in peoples rooms in my houses. Replaced my brothers cash with a iou, stole my parents change jar, dug through any change container.

\-literally shoplifted some crap called 7oh and vodka when I couldnt steal any edibles when i was particularly bored and just didn't want to be sober. Isn't even the first time recently, Ive stolen gum, a charger, a few things that I just simply can't afford rn when I only get the occasional influx of a small amount of money I immediately want to get high with. This is one of the most concerning for me because I grew up a very strict christian, and while my morals have shifted heavily over the years, I have NEVER thought seriously about stealing and thought it was wrong, and at this point I literally just dont gaf anymore. Wasnt even nervous about it. If there were packs of edibles sitting out at stores like alcohol is, itd be game over lol.

\-have wanted to go on a trip i planned a bit ago to see my cousin, just need like 100$. Well, I decided to sell all my old video games I dont almost ever play to get money, wouldnt want to if i didnt need, but desperate times... I made 70$. Not bad, had another thing or two I could sell the next day, should be alright. (Well If I had just saved ""my"" money for the last month id be alright but no, I just get 10$ over and over and say screw it.) I told myself, I wont buy any weed unless im fs I have enough for the trip and extra. Well, I just drive by it and say screw it, Ill be wasting gas if I dont get it now. I then decide instead of one little pack, lets pay a little more for the 30$ pack and be good for a while. Then Im in the car and I all the sudden realize what I just did. Like, I very likely wont have enough money at all for the trip now. Because I couldnt simply have enough patience to wait. Like wtf is wrong with me lmao.

As far as anything else goes, its not like I am drastically more irritable on days when im sober, and there wasnt too many significant differences on long breaks either. My tolerance gets insane btw. Im not kidding you at one point i worked at a depressing factory and I have casually eaten a jar of like 8000mg (shitty d8 stuff but still) and just worked like normal. A little high. Ill regularly get up to that level, where one purchase is ONE high. Cause I cant just wait like 1-3 weeks. Its bad. BTW i have actually noticed some slight nausea several days after getting high a lot in a row, then stopping. I will say it could possibly be aimlessness and boredom. I am extremely dissatisfied with my life as it is, no real great plans, and no friends or groups to join. I have a good job where Im moving away soon which will help, but yeah rn Ill do whatever. It is a genuinely good thing I dont have any dealer friends, as annoying as thats been in the past, because straight up if I can look a drug up on google and people will tell me it wont kill me, fuck it ill try it.

1jf2irl,2025-03-19 23:28:44,Active addiction is back.,"Hello, I hope this text finds everyone well. It took almost a year of hard work, dedication and consistency for my neuropathways to turn from a highway of hell to a deer trail. I kicked the shit, the drink, the smoke, everything. Completed 3 months of in/outpatient treatment, lived in sober housing, attended meetings everyday, involved with sober community as much as I can. I made it to 10 months of honest sobriety. Then I smoked a cig (personal choice to classify it as an abused substance), then bought a pack, then took a psilocybin gummy, then took it every other day, then I thought, ""one beer wouldn't hurt"". It didn't hurt, but making that choice, it loosened a discipline screw, as if to say ""promises that I make for myself don't matter"". Then I hit a dab pen. Then I made a routine of enjoying 3 tall boys each night while in a sober house (in my room). The dopamine created an illusion of a grand ol time. Instant stress reliever too. Lazy. Then I got a job at a bougie bar (because the tips are great). First job of my ""sober"" lifestyle. At this point, I still haven't changed my original sobriety date. Mind you, even though I was spiraling, my life was extremely productive. Full time student, gym 6 times a week, volunteering, pursuing passions (acting, modeling, art). Never had so many healthy relationships in my life. So l, i started getting some money under my belt and decided to move out of sober living, with a buddy of mine from rehab (who had relapsed already). The day that I packed the uhaul van and drove it off the driveway for the last time, i immediately asked my buddy to get an 8ball. We got fucked up. I didn't sleep for 2-3 days. Was stuck in a loop of satisfying the wildfire of my serial urges. Tinder, porn, massage parlors. At the beginning of the comedown, I realized that all of those ""missions and quests"" which I had been on the past 2 days to satisfy my urges were pointless. Paranoia, fear, feeling of impending doom had set in, and everything beneath the surface of my skin was trapped in a purgatory. Hell. Literally. It was a dejavu, because for 5 years I was a meth addict with a fetish for sleep deprived and drug induced psychosis. I found myself being overcome by the same emotional paralysis and absolute devastation which had been the catalyst to get sober in the first place. After eventually sleeping for 2 days, I woke up. Doom was gone, I was well rested (somewhat), sun was shining, squirrels were hurrying nuts, everything was back to normal. The relief was immense. I knew I had fucked up, and now I needed to correct the course. After all, I am aware of all the truthful clichés in AA, and knew that there was a way back to redemption. Over the next month, I found myself slowly sinking. Tallboy turned into a Sixpack, Sixpack into a twelver, and twelver into another twelver.. All within a 14 hour period. Secrets, shame, guilt, anger, sadness, started to pile up within, as I held on to denial with honor and even some sort of awareness. It turned into a me against the world. I became a stranger and people became stranger. Although, I held on to some principles I've learned, and made sure to maintain my responsibilities as to not prove correct the often mentioned phrase - thanks to addiction,  I lost everything in my life. (Paraphrasing) By the end of December, all I did was study, work, drink and fuck my new gf, whom I declared my loyalty and absolutely love to in a state of a drunken euphoria, and made sure to be really convincing, for the sake or personal comfort. She was/is in the program too, struggling I might add. I made her look like frigging Bill himself. I became desperate and depressed as fuck. Destructive, angry. An opportunity came along to go abroad and live with my family for the winter quarter. It was perfect because I needed a hard reset. Bought a one way ticket, and got a sense of relief. I'm not as hopeless and stuck as I thought. Anyway, let me go grab a 12 pack before the store closes.. you know what, let's make it 2, and 4 Tallboys. I never made it to my flight the next day. I woke up 2 days later, on my floor, by myself, having suffered at least one seizure (I'm epileptic and can recognize post seizure symptoms), phone had 50 missed calls from my family, because I never arrived there and Noone could reach me. It was surreal. I didn't know what was going on. Absolutely fried. Made it on a plane the next day.. Finally, the light at the end of the tunnel. Surely, being on a different continent will allow me to reset, get my shit straight, drop the habits again and focus. Well, even though it has been a spiritual experience like I intended, the abuse technically got worse. Since being here for 2 months, I've begun to use meth again, drinking like an elephant, engaging in risky behavior (sexual and otherwise). So, as I sit here right now, on day 2 of no sleep, smelling like coconut oil, lube and burnt meth, trying to control the circumference of my eyeballs so that I don't look like ... a crazy person, wondering how my favorite pornstar of the day is holding up without my intense supervision of her performance as I type this, while plotting on ways that I can inspire or win over an escort to give me a session on the house, or what specific series of words I need to use to convince a woman on tinder to be my personal pornstar for the night, or...ah  you get the gist, I am genuinely beyond scared, just like a front line soldier who is numb to the chaos and atrocities, because I am gaslighting myself about the fact that I have a serious issue. Meth isn't the same thing as eating a KitKat on your cheatday from the gym, I can't just run it off and be scot free from circumstances especially with my epilepsy. I need help but I don't feel desperate enough to admit the seriousness of what's going on with me. I'm so fucking depressed. So much on my mind I have to get it off my chest. What would my granny say if she saw me snorting death. 

God, grant me the serenity, to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. God, thank you for blessing me with another day on this beautiful planet and with a will to fight. Even though it is a dark time right now, it is happening for a reason. It has to be. Show me the way. Allow me to be the light amongst darkness. Place me where you need me to be. 

Thank you for allowing me to vent.

Hello, I hope this text finds everyone well. It took almost a year of hard work, dedication and consistency for my neuropathways to turn from a highway of hell to a deer trail. I kicked the shit, the drink, the smoke, everything. Completed 3 months of in/outpatient treatment, lived in sober housing, attended meetings everyday, involved with sober community as much as I can. I made it to 10 months of honest sobriety. Then I smoked a cig (personal choice to classify it as an abused substance), then bought a pack, then took a psilocybin gummy, then took it every other day, then I thought, ""one beer wouldn't hurt"".

1jd8p7x,2025-03-17 15:34:55,How to handle dating an addict ?,"Hello,

F29 here. I've been seeing a M36 for 1 1/2 months. We met at a work seminar (we work in finance) and I would never have guessed his addiction as he is very functional. At first, he was reluctant to date me because of his problems with coca_ine and we_ed. He's been using them daily, on his own or with others, for years, to the point he could take both on his own after work at home regularly. He started his recovery/rehab a few days before we met.

We see each other regularly: 3-4 times a week. We get on very well and the relationship is quite intense, both sexually and emotionally. We haven't formalized our status yet, as I don't want to rush him as he's going through a difficult period.

Unfortunately, I'm starting to worry. He's very lonely: 3 friends he doesn't see very often, his family is far away. I'm the only person in his daily life. Also, he sometimes relapses (about once a week, which is better than every day, but... still worrying as he has health issues due to this). He also has deep depression and generalized anxiety with panic attacks (he has medication for this but I'm nor sure he's taking it properly). Sometimes I have to calm him down, which I manage to do easily, I don't really know how.

He says that seeing me makes him feel better. It encourages him to get up, tidy up and cook. Our sex life was catastrophic the first few times because he couldn't maintain an erection, but I restored his confidence and now it's crazy good. In a short space of time, I've become a sort of backbone for him.

But he also has very rapid mood swings. He's always nice to me, but I can still feel the sometimes violent swings. One minute he's happy, bordering on euphoria; the next, he's angry, hard and cold, bitter.

The difficulty also lies in the fact that he's lost in what he's feeling for me and what's next for us.

I tried to ask him if we were gf/bf but he said there were things he needed to talk to me about and that he needed time to think. I'm pretty sure these things have something to do with his addictions.

What do you think? I'm very attached to him, he's a great person, but sometimes I feel helpless and/or hurt by some of his mood swings; not to mention the relapses, which worry me because I care about his mental and physical state.

Never touched it sober but every time I get drunk it’s basically the only thing I can think about. Now I can stop drinking again for a while. I’m hoping that works but is there something I can do to trick or adjust my brain to stop thinking about it?

Never touched it sober but every time I get drunk it’s basically the only thing I can think about. Now I can stop drinking again for a while. I’m hoping that works but is there something I can do to trick or adjust my brain to stop thinking about it? 

Like I said it’s basically an addiction while drinking but I don’t ever crave it sober. Any tips are appreciated. I’ve disappointed myself and people I love. 

Thank you guys. Addiction runs in my family and I’m really trying.","{'neg': 0.108, 'neu': 0.736, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.8842}",0.8842,Positive,0,0,"['drinking', 'blow', 'drunk', 'sober', 'basically', 'introduced', 'regretting', 'addiction', 'reliant', 'dealer']",Low Concern

1jgzmcr,2025-03-22 09:39:04,My Stimulant Addiction,"When I use stimulants, for some reason I never want the feeling to fade away. It's like when you're a little kid and your mom drops you off at school for the first time, you cling onto her and cry for her to take you home. That's what I feel like when I'm coming down.

I have struggled with motivation and depression for years. I have been told by people in my family many times that I'm lazy, I dont try hard enough and don't ever reach my full potential. That message being repeated for so many years has made me want to do anything possible to get rid of that feeling - which essentially are all my symptoms of depression.

Obviously when I use stimulants, that feeling disappears completely. I believe there is something in me that feels if I was this motivated when I was younger, maybe my family and friends wouldn't be so disappointed in me. That combined with the fact that narcotics are just generally addictive, I have become a (barely) functional addict. Although I do not live on the streets anymore, my life is very isolating because of this addiction.

I don't like to be in public when I'm high, mostly because I think it's disrespectful, especially around children. I can also get paranoid if I do too much or don't get enough sleep, so I don't want to risk having a total breakdown or panic attack in public (negativdly affecting others). I also don't see my child very often, because I do not want to be around her high.

I am very ashamed of myself, mostly the fact that I just can't se to make the choice to be in full recovery. I let my mind ruin riot, my emotions take over and everything becomes chaotic - or attempting to manage this self inflicted chaos. 

I don't know why I can't seem to grasp the reality of how much the pros outweigh the cons in my situation. I can explain it, understand it, etc. But for some reason it doesn't seem to be enough to convince me to stop this. I know it's terrible and extremely dangerous - so why so I still do it?

Anyways, let me know of any of you have advice for stimulant addiction. Thanks guys

I don't know why I can't seem to grasp the reality of how much the pros outweigh the cons in my situation. I can explain it, understand it, etc. But for some reason it doesn't seem to be enough to convince me to stop this. I know it's terrible and extremely dangerous - so why so I still do it?

Anyways, let me know of any of you have advice for stimulant addiction. Thanks guys

1jghm5u,2025-03-21 20:06:02,Anyone resentful they were born?,"So my origin story frustrates me to no end.

My mom had to do fertility treatments for a while before she got pregnant the first time. Unfortunately after giving birth he died. A year later she did the treatments again and ended up giving birth to my sister. Then she planned on divorcing my dad… but surprise! She found out she was pregnant with me… no fertility treatments. She considered abortion but ended up keeping me. After I was born she got so depressed she wouldn’t hold me. She ended up planning to kill me but doctors intervened and put her on meds and she did not end up killing me. Years later she gave birth again with the help of fertility treatments with her new husband…

I keep asking myself why I am even alive. Like what was the purpose? I wasn’t supposed to be around. My barely fertile mom somehow had a surprise child and considered getting rid of me twice… like I don’t think I should be around.

So my origin story frustrates me to no end.

My mom had to do fertility treatments for a while before she got pregnant the first time. Unfortunately after giving birth he died. A year later she did the treatments again and ended up giving birth to my sister. Then she planned on divorcing my dad… but surprise! She found out she was pregnant with me… no fertility treatments. She considered abortion but ended up keeping me. After I was born she got so depressed she wouldn’t hold me. She ended up planning to kill me but doctors intervened and put her on meds and she did not end up killing me. Years later she gave birth again with the help of fertility treatments with her new husband…

I keep asking myself why I am even alive. Like what was the purpose? I wasn’t supposed to be around. My barely fertile mom somehow had a surprise child and considered getting rid of me twice… like I don’t think I should be around.

I feel like this is one of those things that’s hard to put into words—something that people who don’t have the disorder might not fully understand. But I wanted to share and hear your thoughts/experiences.

I recently went through a really bad psychosis episode, and honestly, it was terrifying. For weeks, I felt like I was slipping in and out of reality, hallucinating so much that I couldn’t tell what was real and what wasn’t. My brother even joked to me about a man hiding in the closet when I was clearly in a state of distress. I’m not a child who thinks a monster is under the bed. I have an illness. It IS real to me in the moment. When I’d try to describe it to a friend, I’d get that look—like they just couldn’t wrap their head around it. And while my friends are sympathetic, they’ll never truly get IT you know? That’s fine, but I can’t shake this.

It’s isolating. I feel like I exist in this “bipolar bubble”—like I’m here with everyone else, but there’s still some invisible barrier separating me from “normal” people.

I know some of you might say, “Why does it matter what other people think?” or “Just don’t pay any mind.” And normally, I don’t. But this feeling isn’t about caring what others think—it’s about that deep, unshakable sense of just being different. I know we’re all different, but I’m sure you all know the kind of different I’m referring to when it comes to having this disorder.

1jfcegm,2025-03-20 06:30:56,What does your mania look like? How does it compare to hypomania?,"As discussed in a different post, I recently got a potential prognosis of bipolar. I was wondering what your manic episodes are like? I can easily identify my depressive episodes in my life, but can't exactly pinpoint a ""manic"" episode, although I am not very well versed in what it all means yet.

The most ""manic"" episode would probably be two years ago, starting around my birthday, when I started dating multiple people at once and cheated on my then boyfriend of two years with multiple people, one night stands, and even starting a whole second relationship. It was my absolute lowest and yet I felt like the most desirable woman in the world at that time. Was this due to mania I have no idea.

How does it compare to hypomania? As discussed in a different post, I recently got a potential prognosis of bipolar. I was wondering what your manic episodes are like? I can easily identify my depressive episodes in my life, but can't exactly pinpoint a ""manic"" episode, although I am not very well versed in what it all means yet.

The most ""manic"" episode would probably be two years ago, starting around my birthday, when I started dating multiple people at once and cheated on my then boyfriend of two years with multiple people, one night stands, and even starting a whole second relationship. It was my absolute lowest and yet I felt like the most desirable woman in the world at that time. Was this due to mania I have no idea.

Like I have to filter so much but everyone else is allowed to be the biggest ass to me. For example my bf and I are in the middle of finding a place to live and I got a stomach virus so I couldn’t go to work. He literally yelled at me and gave me a lecture about money. I bring more into the house than he does and I have the stomach flu. (I’ve been off my meds for 4 days because I can’t keep them down) I understand this is a problem. It’s not like I want to do this. I just don’t understand why he’s allowed to be a jerk but if I hang up on him because he’s silent on the phone then I’m “out of control and need to go to the hospital because of my bipolar”. It’s so maddening. I think I am holding my shit together fairly well considering I went to work today even after I vomited twice and I finished the whole day without an episode.

I bring more into the house than he does and I have the stomach flu. (I’ve been off my meds for 4 days because I can’t keep them down) I understand this is a problem. It’s not like I want to do this. I just don’t understand why he’s allowed to be a jerk but if I hang up on him because he’s silent on the phone then I’m “out of control and need to go to the hospital because of my bipolar”.

1jfghg1,2025-03-20 10:03:25,Seriously struggling with side effect of weight gain,"

Let me start off by saying how grateful I am to have access to both of these life-saving medications. I was hospitalized in December for a severe manic episode and put on an antipsychotic, which immediately put my psychosis in check. My doctor put me on one antipsychotic and one mood stabilizer and kept me on them to stabilize me. I’m doing fine now, thank goodness.

But in the three months since starting the medications, I have gained a significant amount of weight. This has had a catastrophic effect on my self-esteem, body image, and body dysmorphia. I hate my body and am miserable in it every single day. 

I watch what I eat, I go to the gym twice/three times a week, I drink plenty of water, everything you need to do to maintain a healthy normal weight. I see a therapist. But the medication stacks the odds against me. Other than the weight gain, these medications have had no side effects for me. 

I decided to go off one antipsychotic with the help of my doctor a month ago, but still the weight has stuck around and even gone up still being on the mood stabilizer. 

My body is revolting against me and I want to listen to it. I don’t want to, and will not, accept this new weight as my new body weight. I still want to take medicine to manage my bipolar, but I don’t want it to come at the cost of me hating my body.

My doctor put me on one antipsychotic and one mood stabilizer and kept me on them to stabilize me. I’m doing fine now, thank goodness.

But in the three months since starting the medications, I have gained a significant amount of weight. This has had a catastrophic effect on my self-esteem, body image, and body dysmorphia. I hate my body and am miserable in it every single day. 

I watch what I eat, I go to the gym twice/three times a week, I drink plenty of water, everything you need to do to maintain a healthy normal weight. I see a therapist. But the medication stacks the odds against me. Other than the weight gain, these medications have had no side effects for me. 

I decided to go off one antipsychotic with the help of my doctor a month ago, but still the weight has stuck around and even gone up still being on the mood stabilizer. 

My body is revolting against me and I want to listen to it. I don’t want to, and will not, accept this new weight as my new body weight. I still want to take medicine to manage my bipolar, but I don’t want it to come at the cost of me hating my body. 

Please be delicate in the comments. I’m really sensitive about this topic. ","{'neg': 0.107, 'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.125, 'compound': -0.1346}",-0.1346,Negative,0,3,"['weight', 'body', 'antipsychotic', 'medications', 'effect', 'stabilizer', 'gain', 'mood', 'want', 'doctor']",Moderate Concern

1jeqg3f,2025-03-19 12:05:37,My boyfriend just faked his death in front of me,"I (25F) have been in a relationship with my (now ex) boyfriend since July. When the good times were good, they were so beyond amazing. But when the bad times were bad, it was BAD. 

I was tired of the constant fighting and the toxicity between the both of us, so i decided to end it today. 

He stabbed himself in front of me. He was bleeding out all over the floor and I called 911 as i was pressing on his stomach where the stab wound was. While on the phone with 911, he starts running out of the apartment to the parking garage and goes up to the 6th floor. He then climbs up onto the ledge and sits on it and starts scooting closer to the ledge. 

At this point, the police show up and try to talk him down from the ledge. I then hangup with 911 and call my sister. As I’m screaming and shrieking and pleading and begging for him to please don’t, he Fucking jumps. 

I thought i had just witnessed his death, with his blood covered all over me. I shriek, my sister heard everything over the phone. I feel so bad. 

Turns out, he jumped into someone’s balcony and only fell 1 story thank God… but to ME, for about 45 minutes i thought i had just watched him jump to his death in front of me. I grieved his death with his Fucking blood all over my hands and arms for almost an hour. 

He’s now currently in the hospital and i have not gone to see him nor do I plan to. I’m so Fucking traumatized. My sister and her BF came into the apartment to clean up all the blood, which was a LOT. I packed a bag and I’m staying at her place for now. I cant Fucking believe it. 

I loved him so much and it wasn’t because i didn’t love him that i wanted to leave him i just couldn’t handle the toxic parts anymore. I’m traumatized for life. And the worst thing is i wish we could still be together but we Fucking cant. I hate this. I miss him, but i can’t go back, especially after this…

***UPDATE*** - I am being waived of all fees and am moving to a new apartment on Friday THANK GOD! I have downloaded Tetris and have been playing that all day, it has helped a little bit so thanks to everyone for that suggestion. 

The property manager took me and my sister up to the roof to show me how staged it all was. To ME it looked like he jumped off the building, but in reality he just jumped onto the roof that was about 12-15 feet down. The walls were so high though that i couldn’t tell the difference of the illusion. After he jumped, he couldn’t make it any further because he passed out from blood loss (from the stab wound). 

I’ve been speaking with his dad and as of right now it seems like he will be moving three states away back with his dad when he’s discharged. Either that, or across the country to move in with his mom. As for the restraining order, I’m going to look into that and see what I can do. He’s called me from the hospital phone twice today but I’ve let my sister talk to him instead of me. He said he was scared and didn’t know what to do, she said we are not helping him and that he did this to himself by doing that sick shit he did to me. If anything, the most we’re gonna do is turn in his phone and ID to the hospital so he at least has that. (He left everything of his in the apartment after the stabbing and the jump, so he had nothing on him when he was taken to the ER). I’m not sure if he’s being admitted into a psych ward or if he’s being released, but that’s for him and his dad to figure out. Thankfully his dad is on my side and i have a good relationship with his family.

1jeds1n,2025-03-19 01:38:05,My baby died and I feel like it’s all my fault,"I’m 17 now and have been holding this secret for a while. I first got raped at 8. And it happened multiple times. I reported it at 12 but nothing was done by the police. And my parents felt a lot of guilt for not realising it was happening. 

Then when I was 14 I was raped again by someone else. This time it was my fault because I was high and drunk at the time. Which I actually started doing because I was traumatised. So I didn’t report it because I knew the police wouldn’t do anything. And I knew it was my fault for being high. I ended up using even more to cope with it and tried to kill myself. I was saved but was in a very critical state. I was in hospital for a while.

They actually asked if there was any chance I could be pregnant and I said no. Which was stupid but my parents were in the room.

Once I got home I still drank a lot. Not drugs but whatever alcohol I could steal from my parents stash. But after maybe a few weeks or months after I got back I started to have the classic pregnancy symptoms and got really scared and I hadn’t had my period for a while. So I was panicking. I didn’t want to tell my parents but I did “jokingly” ask them “hypothetical” questions about what they’d do in certain situations and one of them is if I got pregnant young and they said they’d be mad at me.

So I definitely didn’t want to tell them after that. I decided eventually to steal a pregnancy test. I was hoping it would go away and I wouldn’t have to face it so was putting it off thinking maybe I was paranoid. But I’d stopped drinking just incase. Because of the suicide attempt I wasn’t allowed out of the house on my own so I’d decided that I was going to steal it when I went to town with my friend which was a week away from when I decided this.

At this point tho I was fairly certain I was pregnant I mean I had a bump. And had missed my period for like 4 months at this point. And lots of people even my family were saying they were worried about my weight gain but they didn’t think I was pregnant they thought it was because of health issues. But I decided to accept the possibility of being pregnant and maybe if I don’t have an abortion things won’t be that bad and maybe I’m supposed to have this baby to change my life around to be better for my child and I started to get in a fucked up way comforted by the thought of having a baby. Which I know now was stupid probably but I thought for sure this was my sign I needed to keep living and change my life around. And I even started looking at places me and the baby could live once I was older and a job I could get to save up money. 

And I was looking at baby clothes and getting baby fever honestly. And I felt like if I was pregnant it would be ok. And I was thinking of baby names. Just imagining how “good” my life would be with a baby. I knew it would be hard and I especially know that now I’m more mature but I was almost glamorising it in my head. That this would all be ok and I’d be a “great mother”. 

But before I even got the chance to confirm I was pregnant like literally a day before I had extreme stomach pain. Like the worst pain I’d ever felt. I was screaming and within seconds I’d bled through my underwear and sheets. My mum said it’s a really heavy period. She gets them. She gave me a really thick pad and told me to change. I could barely even walk to the bathroom I was in that much pain when I was on the toilet parts of the feetus was coming out. And I was just sobbing. I could literally make out parts of its hands and head and stuff it was really traumatising. I probably should’ve gone to the hospital but I didn’t. 

I didn’t tell my parents it wasn’t just a period. I couldn’t. I’ve since had issues with my uterus and ovaries. So I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to have a baby when I’m older. Probably for the best. But sometimes I do wish the pregnancy worked out. Maybe I would’ve changed for the better. And I know it’s my fault I even got raped in the first place and that it died because of the alcohol and drugs and suicide attempt. If I didn’t do that maybe the baby would still be alive or I at least would’ve been in control of having an abortion or letting someone adopt them. And maybe if I was a mother I wouldn’t have attempted suicide after and my alcoholism wouldn’t have gotten worse and id be a happy mother. I love kids I know it would’ve been hard but I feel like I would’ve figured it out by now.

I wouldn’t have minded not going to college or uni if I wasn’t able to. I don’t even go to college (uk) now. Because of health issues. So maybe I would be a full time mother right now instead of spending all day crying in bed because my life is so depressing and I just want to die. 

I feel like it’s too late to tell anyone now and if my parents found out they’d be devastated. Even more devastated that I didn’t tell them at the time. 

I feel so much guilt. Like I’m a murderer. A girl I know got pregnant at 16 and she’s 18 now and whenever I see her posting about her son I feel like that’s what I’m missing out on.

I first got raped at 8. And it happened multiple times. I reported it at 12 but nothing was done by the police. And my parents felt a lot of guilt for not realising it was happening. 

Then when I was 14 I was raped again by someone else. This time it was my fault because I was high and drunk at the time. Which I actually started doing because I was traumatised. So I didn’t report it because I knew the police wouldn’t do anything. And I knew it was my fault for being high. I ended up using even more to cope with it and tried to kill myself. I was saved but was in a very critical state. I was in hospital for a while.

They actually asked if there was any chance I could be pregnant and I said no. Which was stupid but my parents were in the room.

Once I got home I still drank a lot. Not drugs but whatever alcohol I could steal from my parents stash. But after maybe a few weeks or months after I got back I started to have the classic pregnancy symptoms and got really scared and I hadn’t had my period for a while. So I was panicking. I didn’t want to tell my parents but I did “jokingly” ask them “hypothetical” questions about what they’d do in certain situations and one of them is if I got pregnant young and they said they’d be mad at me.

So I definitely didn’t want to tell them after that. I decided eventually to steal a pregnancy test. I was hoping it would go away and I wouldn’t have to face it so was putting it off thinking maybe I was paranoid. But I’d stopped drinking just incase. Because of the suicide attempt I wasn’t allowed out of the house on my own so I’d decided that I was going to steal it when I went to town with my friend which was a week away from when I decided this.

At this point tho I was fairly certain I was pregnant I mean I had a bump. And had missed my period for like 4 months at this point. And lots of people even my family were saying they were worried about my weight gain but they didn’t think I was pregnant they thought it was because of health issues. But I decided to accept the possibility of being pregnant and maybe if I don’t have an abortion things won’t be that bad and maybe I’m supposed to have this baby to change my life around to be better for my child and I started to get in a fucked up way comforted by the thought of having a baby. Which I know now was stupid probably but I thought for sure this was my sign I needed to keep living and change my life around. And I even started looking at places me and the baby could live once I was older and a job I could get to save up money. 

And I was looking at baby clothes and getting baby fever honestly. And I felt like if I was pregnant it would be ok. And I was thinking of baby names. Just imagining how “good” my life would be with a baby. I knew it would be hard and I especially know that now I’m more mature but I was almost glamorising it in my head. That this would all be ok and I’d be a “great mother”. 

But before I even got the chance to confirm I was pregnant like literally a day before I had extreme stomach pain. Like the worst pain I’d ever felt. I was screaming and within seconds I’d bled through my underwear and sheets. My mum said it’s a really heavy period. She gets them. She gave me a really thick pad and told me to change. I could barely even walk to the bathroom I was in that much pain when I was on the toilet parts of the feetus was coming out. And I was just sobbing. I could literally make out parts of its hands and head and stuff it was really traumatising. I probably should’ve gone to the hospital but I didn’t. 

I didn’t tell my parents it wasn’t just a period. I couldn’t. I’ve since had issues with my uterus and ovaries. So I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to have a baby when I’m older. Probably for the best. But sometimes I do wish the pregnancy worked out. Maybe I would’ve changed for the better. And I know it’s my fault I even got raped in the first place and that it died because of the alcohol and drugs and suicide attempt. If I didn’t do that maybe the baby would still be alive or I at least would’ve been in control of having an abortion or letting someone adopt them. And maybe if I was a mother I wouldn’t have attempted suicide after and my alcoholism wouldn’t have gotten worse and id be a happy mother. I love kids I know it would’ve been hard but I feel like I would’ve figured it out by now.

I wouldn’t have minded not going to college or uni if I wasn’t able to. I don’t even go to college (uk) now. Because of health issues. So maybe I would be a full time mother right now instead of spending all day crying in bed because my life is so depressing and I just want to die. 

I feel like it’s too late to tell anyone now and if my parents found out they’d be devastated. Even more devastated that I didn’t tell them at the time. 

I feel so much guilt. Like I’m a murderer. A girl I know got pregnant at 16 and she’s 18 now and whenever I see her posting about her son I feel like that’s what I’m missing out on. She and her son look like they have a great life. I know she’s probably stuggling and 16 is a bit different than 14 but I don’t know why I still feel like I’m grieving this.

I want to die. I feel crazy. But that was probably my only chance to have a baby on my own. And I probably wouldn’t be allowed to adopt when I’m older because of my mental health past and I guess present. I volunteer with children though. At a local drama group.

I’m tired, worn down and exhausted. I had no clue what I signed up for until I realized, WTF! 
I love him, but that only goes so far, when you see them as your other child you have to literally take care of.
I’ve fought tooth and nail to get him help, keep him on the right meds to help his PTSD, keep up on all his VA appointments and even put him through outpatient VA PTSD treatment when he was relapsing into another manic state.
Well, I can say in all my efforts, this man is nothing but miserable inside and out.
He continues to smoke a pack a day smelling like an ashtray which disgusts me, and lives the most unhealthiest life I’ve ever seen anyone live.
It’s clear he hates himself that much, it’s so bad I cannot sleep in the same room with him because he start smelling like cigarettes and stale feet.
I’m a clean person who also has ADHD, OCD and PTSD from abuse in previous marriages.

My partner has CPTSD from previous relationships. They're usually really communicative during sex in terms of if/when we need to stop, setting boundaries, and setting the pace.

This time round I haven't recovered.

My daughter disowned me & lied to everyone about me. She caused major issues for me & I can't legally see her anymore. It broke me as a father. 
I had a severe nervous breakdown & irrationally closed my business.

1jdbjt9,2025-03-17 18:34:00,I think I have ptsd but dont know how to get help,"Hi,I need advice on getting help.

I have experienced a lot of trauma my entire life, at 35 I live an isolated reclusive life. I do not use social media and posting here I feel nervous of responses but I dont know what else to do.

I have had professional bodies suggest I have PTSD but there has never been progression from that comment. I do feel like it could be possible after reading a lot of the symptoms.

I have no friends or family, I only have my 4 children. I go to the local corner shop maybe once or twice a month if something was missing on my online grocery shop but I need one of my children with me and either go just as it opens or just as it closes. It can take days to build up for this.

I am jumpy if the door knocks, my phone rings or even just hearing sounds outside even though no one knows where I live except the landlord and my doctor.

I went to my doctor last summer and they suggested social anxiety and prescribed sertraline and propranolol. I repeat this prescription online and despite saying I feel no effect it just increases. 

I think it is more than social anxiety but I dont know how to get help past going to my gp.

My triggers are so high that I haven't even slept in a bed for almost 6 years despite moving and getting a new bed.

I have lived completely isolated for 3 years (no family or social relationships) except for work however an incident left me walking out and not returning a year ago. I have worked since i was 11 being able to mask myself so it is a sign of escalation that I cannot even work anymore. Nothing bad has happened to me since this so personally I get sad sometimes that I dont have a single person in this world other than my children but overall I would be content living like this for my own safety but I worry about my fears and safety mechanisms rubbing off on and/or negatively affecting my children so I guess I need to try and get help but I dont know where to turn.

And I blocked him every time. I’ve reported him to the police before but they didn’t do anything. Today he made another account for the first time in a few months on instagram. I decided to try again to find out more information to get him arrested. 

I went to my blocked list and found his main account again. It’s private so I couldn’t see his followers or anything. But I decided to look up his username on Google to see if he had another account under that name. It came up with a post he was tagged in on Instagram. His sister in law. And tagged in the post also was his (adult) niece. 

I then messaged him on the new account he made saying “I wonder what (SIL) and (Niece) would think about this” He then started begging me not to message them. And started deleting all of his messages but I showed him I have screenshots. He then was saying he’s going to change and he’s going to stop raping and harassing people and saying he’ll go to therapy. I acted like I wasn’t going to tell them if he apologised and was honest with me so he would incriminate himself more. I even got him to say the names and ages of the other girls he’s done this too.

I then scrolled through the sister in laws instagram more and saw a post of her talking at HIS and his wife’s wedding. Which is when I found out he was married which I didn’t know. I then sent the same message I sent to the SIL and Niece to the wife and everyone else tagged in the wedding post.  

It’s 5am so they haven’t seen it yet. I’m starting to feel really guilty. Because of the wife especially. I didn’t know he was married. And I feel like him having a wife just makes it all worse.

Is what I’m doing crossing the line? I just feel like this is the only way he’ll possibly get arrested and stop. And he was so cocky up until this point but now he seems genuinely upset and scared. And at first it felt good but now I just feel awful.

So, I reported her to the company’s anonymous reporting line thing, but nothing was ever said, but I also reported it to Cell Phone Company corporate. I didn’t hear anything for about a week, and work was pretty tense and awkward, thankfully I only had to work with her a couple of days before everything happened. A couple of things that I didn’t include in my original post, my bosses boss was in the room with us when this occurred. Once she slammed the door and left, he started yelling at me too and slamming his hands and objects on the desk. I don’t remember what was said, I believe this is the first time I disassociated but I don’t really know. When I came to, I was standing up walking out of the room and I heard him say that he wouldn’t save my job again.

Fast forward to when we did work together, she tried to act like everything was just like normal. No apology, no anything. I got an email that my complaint with corporate had been forwarded to the people it needed to be forwarded to. I went to work that day. My boss tried to call me in the middle of my shift out of the blue. I freaked out, I was scared that she found out I reported her and got upset at me and was going to give me down the road again. So I left work, I was triggered. This is the second time that I remember disassociating during an episode. I came to in my car driving down the road. 

The director of HR of my company (3rd party cell phone company) emailed me that day, and explained that she’d like to have a conversation with me and we scheduled a phone call for the next morning. 

I felt like she heard me when we talked on the phone, and I felt like she really cared about the situation and that things were going to be different for me going forward. My psychologist recommended that I go on short term disability at this time based on my latest episode including the disassociating. My company doesn’t offer short term disability, fmla or any other paid leave type thing that would give me some sort of income while I get the treatment I need to get. So, they decide that they have to place me on a leave of absence since my doctor has decided that I am disabled. I was immediately sent paperwork to fill out, and given direction to not speak to anyone at the store about anything work related or to go on company property.

(I’ve got all the emails that we have sent to each other about the situation.) So the next dilemma that I had was that I was placed on that leave with no option of being able to work. My therapist and psychologist both advised me that it was probably time to go ahead and file for disability at this point in time, so I retained a lawyer and have since applied for disability. So I can’t work. My return to work date is the end of this month and I am nowhere ready to return to work, as I’ve encountered some roadblocks with insurance (lack of) and sleep, and medication.. so things have been tough. My car is close to repossession. The company that I work for has this charity type system that they tout as something so great for the community and they give back and all this and that. So the HR director told me that she’d get me in touch with the guy that handles that whole project and see if they’d be able to give me some money to get by while I’m in extensive therapy and getting meds right. So me and him had a very good phone call, and he wanted me to type up a whole synopsis of what occurred at work (which I’ve still got a copy of, too) when I sent that to him, he replied very quickly and just said that due to the nature of the situation that they weren’t able to provide me any assistance. Funny enough, my boss told me (even though she wasn’t supposed to) that they’d given one of my coworkers 800 dollars one time because she was about to lose her car. That girl is my bosses best friend from childhood. Then I know that they gave another guy 500 for an insurance deductible because he hit a deer on the way home from work one night, but he was texting while driving.

So it’s been this whole thing, and I’m supposed to go back to work in a week and There’s absolutely no way that I’m near ready for that to happen. Both my boss and her boss are still there with absolutely zero consequence for what occurred. She told me that they were going to take sensitivity training. So I’m the on that got screamed at and I’m sitting at home unpaid while they’re both business as usual.

Open book, if you have any questions.

1jdybvb,2025-03-18 11:58:50,Signs of childhood sexual abuse?,"NSFW POST 

I (19, they/them) have been diagnosed with CPTSD and DID. It's obvious I have been mentally/emotionally and spiritually abused, with rare cases of physical abuse.
A lot of my childhood is missing but I have bits and pieces. I want to try and remember more, I don't like feeling as if parts of my life are missing and not my own.
Though, a few things in my memory, as well as current day feelings, seem suspiciously similar to csa symptoms.
Examples that I can remember from childhood:
- wetting the bed, wetting myself: I have memories of wetting myself and my mom helping clean up, and apologizing about it. These are EXTREMELY blurry so I don't know what age or how often. There's a possibility it could have been a result of being spanked (aka getting my ass beat repeatedly with a wooden or plastic spoon sometimes to the point of bruises). There was also the fact that I often would hold in my urine until the last possible moment, but I theorize that it was an attempt at regaining some control of my life throughout the rest of my trauma. 
- playing inappropriately with toys, re-inacting scenes of intimacy or involving genitals: I've heard of this being more common than I realized, but I thought I would put this in here, because I still have the question of where I learned these things from?
- masturbation from a very young age: children learning how their bodies work/react is normal and natural. And that's most likely what I was doing. However I would always feel an immense amount of guilt and shame and need to keep it secret, which in some ways is normal, and in other ways is a bit concerning. It is very likely it could be a sign of religious trauma? Though I don't know how I could have understood that concept at that young.
- drawing/daydreaming violent or sexual things: it was most likely an outlet for me, and even children can figure out basic concepts of pain and pleasure, it just seems so mature and explicit for 6-10 year old me to spend so much mental energy on this.
- nightmares: mostly typical ptsd nightmare scenario, apart from dreams about being raped or sexually assaulted by family members or strangers.
- hurt (burned) to urinate, itching, clumps of vaginal discharge: this could be related to the holding in urine issue, but these seem to be signs of vaginal or urinary infection. I was never given an explanation for this. I don't even remember if I talked about it with anyone or if I just hoped it would go away. But it was at least annoying and at worst painful and confusing.
- sexualizing myself/being inappropriate with my peers: this could very well come from being parentified at a young age and feeling more mature than I actually was, but I remember trying to discuss explicit things with my peers and especially as I became a tween started to sexualize myself thinking that was the only way I would be liked.
- fascination: I had a heavy curiousity when it came to sexual content and I remember looking up explicit content and reading porn on quora when I was a child, and looking in human anatomy books to try and learn about genitalia so I could better picture them? And then loops back around to the day dreaming. It's ironic though, how whenever my mom would try to discuss sexual intercourse with me in regards to puberty aka ""the talk"" I would cover my ears and talk so I wouldn't have to hear her, I HATED when she tried to discuss it with me.
- odd encounter with mom: this one is more of a longer story. I've always had small breasts so I didn't really wear bras and one night I noticed that my nipples were raw and had scabs on them. I don't remember why this was but it could have been from just rubbing against my shirt unprotected? I was concerned and asked my mom about it and she asked to see so she could assess if I was injured and I remember being very embarrassed and refusing to show her. She insisted and made me feel guilty because she's my mother, so I showed her even though I was very uncomfortable and upset about it, and my mom told me everything was okay and to go back to bed. I don't hold it against her, but it's something that I feel I might still carry with me, even though I wish I didn't.

This could be completely normal human things that children do as they grow up, and I'm just overthinking things, and I am going to bring this up to my next therapist (my current one is leaving and I'm very ad about it), but I thought I would reach out here and try to get some insight.

1jha7nx,2025-03-22 20:53:34,I feel like my grandmother estate is the most traumatic thing I've been through not her just passing but what a abuser male relative has put us through ever since she passed,"My grandmother passed in 2022 of dementia and COVID relations and even though I miss her a lot for she protected me from this abuser male relative but he has made our lives a living hell.

For he has sued me and my mother for false allegations with no evidence proving his claims, he has tried disinheriting me from my grandmother estate MULTIPLE times,and he currently trying to make us homeless by selling our home without our consent and does not negotiate with us to do a buyout even though it fair by law, I have been having multiple non stoping panic attacks ever since he listed our house on the market, this person has assaulted my mother physically multiple times over the years and has a charge against him for doing so.

He is the cause of my diagnosis PTSD from the trauma I have from verbal abuse and domestic violence I've had from him during my childhood still into my adulthood, it's not just me living in fear as a child anymore it's now about financially draining us til we have nothing, I've never been suicidal before til he put our house for sale which been in our family for 50 years

I really can't type the abuse he has put me through for it's painful flashbacks and I rather not remember it for it's very traumatizing towards me

But he basically abusing us through the courts even a judge said to him and his lawyer ""this is abuse of the court system""

My mother has paid out over $30,000 in lawyer fees to defend herself and I from him and within the past year I have finally been collecting disability for all the trauma he has put me through for the past 3 years, and I have miniature horses as emotional support animals with a emotional support animals doctor's note so I believe he would be violating my rights not allowing me to have a place to keep my emotional support animals and other horses, I do feel calmer when I'm around my horses for horses have been in my life since birth

He accumulated more domestic violence charges over there with that partner and I had a restraining order the judge wouldn’t grant permanence to. She extended the temporary 3 times over the course of 2 years so it wouldn’t end up on his record. He broke the temporary by messaging me and harassing me over venmo with his girlfriend and all she did was make him promise to not break it again. She also told me if he’s on the run from the law then I’ll have to prove why I think a restraining order is going to help. He and I have a kid together. And he hasn’t seen her since the day he tried shattering our car windows with us inside while he was screaming profanities about killing us. Like I said that was almost 3 years ago. And recently he came back into the state asking for custody and the same judge granted supervised visitation. Which I was comfortable with. In the lobby of court he came up to me and told me “AS ALWAYS I GET *EXACTLY* WHAT I WANT”. He started calling people on speaker phone loudly talking about me and saying I’m “fucking stupid” and “fucking re+@rded” and over the court appointed app hes refusing to follow court order for visitation. Minimal, neutral responses are met with paragraphs berrading me and telling me he’s not going to follow court order. He’s being condescending and aggressive but not inherently threatening.

I asked the court and they said there isn’t grounds for a restraining order yet until something physical happens AGAIN and I can’t take him to court again about him not following because “the judge just saw you guys” and “if he’s not following court order it’s really only hurting him”. Like nobody gives a flying fuck. My parents told me I should just let by gones be by gones. But with the way he’s acting, they’re growing increasingly frustrated aswell. About a month ago he told me he’s going to find my address through my husbands job. But that’s still not considered threatening enough. I just asked for a peaceful contact order this time and the family law facilitator said I can’t get one because that’s already written into visitation orders. I’m losing sleep and it feels like I’m fucking screaming and nobody hears me. I’m worried something worse is going to happen with my daughter present before anything is done. He’s obviously to me still aggressive and not willing to coparent. Nobody believes me or something. I’m raising these red flags saying this guy can’t be trusted and he’s bothering me. And there is no repercussions for him. My husband is on deployment but will be home soon. I don’t doubt that things might get so far that something awful might happen.

1jep2zl,2025-03-19 10:32:53,Afraid It’s Real,"

I’ve been in therapy for nearly 15 years now. I’ve seen a handful of therapists because for a variety of reasons (not the right fit, moving from Chicago to Seattle, etc).

I provide that context because the therapist I see now, I’ve been seeing her for 2.5 years. I trust her and appreciate her authenticity in sessions. I currently meet with her 2x a week because we are doing IFS work which just requires a bit more time given who I am as a person.

We are narrowing down some topics I have never once shared with a therapist and maybe only
once very very vaguely with a close friend. She asked at the end of our session tonight, “what is this part (IFS work) worried about when sharing about the loudness of the intrusive images?”

My only response: I don’t want them to be real. If they stay with me, there’s still a chance they aren’t real and I’m safer that way, everyone is safer. I’m so so scared of them being real (specific instances of physical and sexual abuse). 

I truly trust her and it’s not about her, well not directly. It’s easier for me to be crazy or I suppose gaslight myself with this stuff. I’m protected as best I can be that way. 

15 years of therapy and I get to this point with my work in therapy.

I’m afraid the things I say will become real, they will have more power, more eyes on them, more oxygen to breathe and become bigger. The monster I’ll have more monsters. 

I need help because if I don’t do something about the loudness, it will kill me. 

I’m hoping someone can provide something that can help me get through this challenge/mental/emotional block. I’ve tried so many things with really great therapists. I’m tired of cheesy quotes and advice. I want authentic honest responses that embrace being raw. I need to know I’m not alone in this fear of things being real or the acknowledgment of things actually happening. 


I have to do something I am incredibly scared of in order to deal with something I’m also incredibly scared of. That’s two incredibly scary things, but I want to live. It’s a western duel and which scary thing is going to make the first move.

She punched me, called me racial slurs, and made me feel very, very unsafe. Every time I tried opening up to family or adults/teachers about it, they’d make excuses, saying, “She doesn’t know what she’s saying/doing.” Or, “She’s disabled!” So I’ve learned to never trust them and suppress my emotions because I knew no one cared. I didn’t feel safe crying at home, so I’d cry on the bus instead. It hurt SO much. No one ever did anything about it. I had to deal with it from 3rd grade to 5th grade. In 5th grade, I struggled with thoughts of SH. My math teacher was the only one who ever listened or cared. She literally saved my life, just by being there for me.

We lived together for nine months, where we basically did everything together, and I was always there for her.

Now, she has been in inpatient treatment for a month. This past weekend, I didn’t see her at all. I think she’s struggling and needs time to rest, but we live only three kilometers apart, and I just can’t wrap my head around not seeing each other at all. I’ve tried to arrange a short visit, even just for a hug, but she keeps saying no.

She often talks about patterns—wanting to do everything alone, struggling to be vulnerable, and having a hard time with love, especially with me because of our deep bond.

We lived together for nine months, where we basically did everything together, and I was always there for her.

Now, she has been in inpatient treatment for a month. This past weekend, I didn’t see her at all. I think she’s struggling and needs time to rest, but we live only three kilometers apart, and I just can’t wrap my head around not seeing each other at all. I’ve tried to arrange a short visit, even just for a hug, but she keeps saying no.

She often talks about patterns—wanting to do everything alone, struggling to be vulnerable, and having a hard time with love, especially with me because of our deep bond. I find this really difficult to understand. As someone without trauma, I can’t grasp the idea of not wanting to see your partner for an entire weekend, not even for a brief moment.

1jfrlt0,2025-03-20 21:32:09,My PTSD makes me feel guilty for standing up for myself and my loved ones make me feel guilty about standing up for myself,"It has become a patter but around COVID was the worst part. Growing up my dad was abusive in so many ways. My siblings supported each other about the abuse but they were not supportive towards me. They resented me because they felt like I was not as abused as they were but his abuse with me was only when it was me and him. I was five and easily manipulated believing him when he made me believe that he had a right to do it until I was 12 and told. First I tried to ask to speak to a counselor at the school but for some reason the teacher was rude and asked me in front of the class why I wanted to see a counselor and expected me to answer in front of the class. I decided to back down. I tried to go in the counselors office before school started but the counselor yelled at me to get out of her office. This scared me to go to the school for help. I later learned that my dad would tell the school I was a problem child. My cousin who stayed with us for a little bit but she abruptly left. She told her caseworker how my dad abused her and is so a caseworker came to talk to me at school. It was the first time I was heard so I told her everything. They took us out and arrested him. My siblings were so hateful towards me saying I ruined the family. As an adult my dad was living at our favorite grandma's and everyone would go over there. I was expected to act like everything is okay. He got out when I was 17 and was forced to visit and he wanted a hug from me but I didn't want to. Everyone was circled around me yelling at me to hug him like I was the problem. I was lied to and did not know I was going to see him. He just got out of jail and I was not ready. I was always uncomfortable at the way he looked at me and I tried to express it but my sister said it was because of the shirt I was wearing. This was the same sister that I told first about the abuse that told me she would protect me and turned on me. 

My brother was always abusive as well when my dad left but my sisters always took his side and said it was because my dad abused him. He was the worse to me and would ostracize me from the other siblings. My best friend who I would always vent to about his abuse had a huge crush on him despite his abuse and would always stand up for him because of the crush. I ended the friendship a year ago when she drunkenly taunt me and laughed like it was nothing saying she would go and sleep with him behind my back after I was venting about his cruelty. She would always use the phrase that she is playing the devils advocate when she stood up for him.

Right before Covid I became my other grandmother's caregiver. I didn't mind caring for her despite how scary it was for me. They knew I would be working a full time job and they expected it. It was under the agreement they would help and they would have someone helping and I would have days off. My first supportive day off my sister caught a wind of it and was mad about it so she hikacked my day off to make my mom make me help her with her shopping. It was only supposed to be a half day but she hijacked all of my to days off and I felt like I did not have a choice. This was the moment I felt like I lost my mind. She was supposed to help out but she bolted before this and would only show up to judge me. The whole time I was helping she judged me on being a caregiver. I was lucky to get an hour of sleep. My family was treating me badly and I only agreed to a certain caregiver but they took advantage of my timid personality. They never got the help. I ended up having to move in as she needed more help. Instead of being grateful they treated me as I was taking advantage. I had to pay rent as I was still paying rent on my place. They fired the lawn guy and expected me to do the lawn and other extra house things. My only job was to make sure she didn't fall but somehow found myself in this situation because they knew they could take advantage. Grandma was being racist towards me too. 

The same time my job was treating me horribly and bullying me. Having me pick up the slack of other coworkers while they got to chat and joke with the manager. I was being punished for being nice and not joining them when they were bullying the other girl that eventually quit. I have speech impediment and they thought it would be funny to force me to do the announcements and they would make fun of my voice. I would do my job but they would stop me to do their favorite's job first to yell at me about my area. My other coworker who was bullied had to go to the hospital while working while I was on vacation. I came back for them to yell at me for the mess that she left behind when she had to go to the emergency room. 

During lockdown my grandma was nice to me as there was no one else yelling in her ear about me. She was nice and we had a good time. I was having anxiety attacks about having to go back to that work environment always being yelled out. I felt confident about talking to my grandma about my worries. Something about lockdown helped her despite her fears of Covid. One morning she surprised me and even got up on her own and made her own coffee and small breakfast. She told me to tell work I can't go back because her as she told me our governor said that living with the elderly was a reasonable excuse for not going back. Besides, my job was not letting us face masks in the beginning before lockdown and did not want to lockdown and let us go home. She wanted me not to go back because they didn't care about safety. I did when they called and she was happy about it but asked me to not tell the family. When restrictions was lifted family came back to visit and after a week grandma became cruel. She became weak and was falling more. She fell when the family was there and they were helping her but they wanted to try to turn it around as me being abusive with their backhanded comments. I was not getting sleep and they could not even let me take a nap. My grandma told me to take a nap for them to wake me up to grab her a glass of water. They were yelling me about the lawn, plants, sweeping the roof, changing the plants. They were always nagging me about when I was going back to work despite it being a lockdown. These people have not worked in over 5 years.

She ended up having to go to the hospital because of her fall. They kept her for a couple of days but we could not be there because of Covid. They were bugging me to check on her instead of calling themselves because I wanted to finally sleep. I called in the morning and they would call for updates. They finally were sending her home and I asked if they could pick her up since I was too tired to drive and everything was blurry. They were ignoring me and finally leaving me alone. I finally had enough and said that if they felt I was not doing a good job with grandma they can do it themselves and I left. 

Of course they were finally able to find someone quickly to help take care of her and they rehired the lawn guy. She was still too much for them and tried to guilt me saying I should come back.

It’s now 2025 and he decided he’s done being robotic. He recently went for disability for ptsd (among other things) and the evaluator wrote an entire NOVEL about how there is “no way” this ‘man’ is struggling this hard and is still alive.

Since starting this process, his triggers (which would normally cause a momentary pause in his day accompanied by a blank stare and rapid breathing with shaking) have evolved. He has been isolating and getting lost in his hobbies (he’s a woodworker)

I’ve asked him how I can best support and help him, and I’m met with “put out more” (no offense here, I recognize that sex is an easy distraction)

1jfj3mh,2025-03-20 13:02:05,Feeling stuck,I got diagnosed back in August 2024 but have been unknowingly dealing with ptsd since childhood. My anxiety got so bad that I ended up getting fired earlier this month due to missing too much work. I live with roommates but with no income I’m going to have to move back in with my family. However my mom is dealing with an undiagnosed mental illness and is a constant trigger source for me. My siblings are doing the best they can to support me but they already go through so much trying to get my mom help that she keeps refusing.

1jejzeg,2025-03-19 06:03:38,Can't vent to my wife anymore,"Hi all,

I was raised by neurodivergent parents who tried hard but left me with a fair amount of repair work in adulthood. I was heavily bullied through school, and went through some pretty awful times from 2013 to 2017, then I had to deal with homophobic family members up until 2022. To keep it short, my psychologist says I have PTSD.

In daily life esp when I'm stressed I get flashbacks, and since living with my wife for 5 years she helps me vent and get through them and I've come so far since 2022. 2 days ago I stood up to a parent who used a childhood nickname to write a review on a business Web page I have. I asked them politely please do not use this name in the future a number of times, but they did it again so I confronted them and they made a fuss but it went OK. It started a heap of flashbacks about the names my sister and I got called in childhood and I told my wife about it, and she listened then broke down saying she couldn't handle it. She has anxiety and depression and I felt so awful. I told her I'd try to keep it to myself from now on.

So how do you keep trauma to yourself? She said I should do a journal or blog or something but I'm freaking out. I feel so distant from her now, and I feel so selfish for putting it all on her like this. She can't handle big emotions so now im scared to show any emotion at all.

1jd1tc3,2025-03-17 07:55:40,I think im gonna quit therapy,"I’ve been in some type of therapy since last summer. I started with a LCSW and we worked on CBT therapy and other minor treatments. The treatment made me feel stupid and like i was overreacting. I liked her a lot and we got along very well, but the treatment wasnt effective.

Nothing got better so they moved me to a psychologist. We’ve been doing EMDR for 2 months and every time i just cry and then pull it together and leave. We dont talk about anything in detail, nothing gets better. My symptoms keep getting worse and then ill get a few days better and then they get worse again. I dont know ANYTHING about him and honestly he doesnt seem like he wants to know anything about me either. I dont trust him really. He doesnt respond much to my EMDR responses and has a super monotone vouce so i feel like he thinks im overreacting too.

I started on Zoloft halfway through this. Nothing felt different at all. They switched me to Lexapro. That made everything worse. So they took me off and moved me to a psychiatrist. But then my psychologist told me the place they sent me to was for people with “severe mental illness” and he didnt want me going there anymore so he was gonna cancel my referal and put me with a telehealth doctor. I actually really liked the peer support specialist that did my intake. But i guess it wouldnt have been a good fit.

Basically, i initially started all of this so i would stop having severe emotional responses to my husband experiencing negative emotions (not towards me, just in general) and going into week long anxiety/depressive episodes. I was okay living with the audio hallucinations, i just wanted the panic to stop and my relationship to get better. Over 6 months later i’ve made no progress, i feel stupid anytime i go to the medical center, and i spend half the time trying to justify my reactions and half the time thinking im overreacting.

1jcnasi,2025-03-16 20:58:33,Overcoming feeling needy,"Yesterday I was spiraling because I know I need to talk to my new partner of two months about a few things and I’ve been struggling to bring them up to him. I posted on a different subreddit for advice and later realized the feelings I had were a PTSD response. 

My parents have always been very dismissive of my feelings and needs. They’re extremely avoidant and always say I’m overly sensitive. I’ve mostly dated men who have been dismissive and avoidant, too. Some have even complained that I don’t share enough, only to say that my needs were “stupid” when I did share. I’ve twisted myself into a pretzel trying to find ways to communicate my needs so that I don’t sound needy, whiny, annoying, overly sensitive, manipulative, etc. (these are all words my parents and some partners have used to describe the way I communicate my needs). Over the years, I’ve just shut down and not shared. I stopped dating for a long time because of it. Therapy and good, supportive friends have helped a lot. But I still have a lot of work to do.

Yesterday I realized why it’s taking me so long to have this talk with him and why it’s making me so anxious, my PTSD. I hadn’t connected the dots before. I’ve rehearsed this conversation so many times trying to find ways to talk to him without breaking down crying, or without saying too much or too little. In the past, I would simply break up with him at this point because it would be too painful to try to communicate (I’m a recovering avoidant myself). But he seems like a great guy in so many ways. I think he will want to address my needs. I just need to say them. My therapist and friends have encouraged me to talk to him for weeks and I’ve been too afraid. 

Anyone else deal with this? Do you have any advice? I’ve debated starting the conversation by telling him that I’m nervous to talk about this because of a trauma response, but then I’ve been second guessing myself. We’re talking at some point in the next 6-7 hours and I’m really nervous!

I should have complied with the leave order. It was stupid and pointless but nothing was wounded except my dignity.

So: now that I know this is a trigger, any tips for future encounters? Is there a standard signal or phrase to use to indicate to LEOs that PTSD is at play? Or is that just a me problem and I'm dead if I don't get my shit together?

1jda65p,2025-03-17 17:14:21,Complete overwhelm and shut down,"Hi there. I hope someone can relate to this as currently i’m feeling really low and at a very dark place.
I was in a 6 year relationship which ended up being super abusive and resulted me having PTSD. The summer (2 y ago) after some events with my ex I completely shut down. I had bad anxiety, panic attacks, DPDR, complete hell for 2.5 months but I managed to recover with no medication. Eventually I left and I started slowly healing.
Sensory overload and overwhelm was persistent since. Not always but when I came on my period and usually a good sleep would recharge me and all would be good again.
Fast forward a year. I healed a lot but my issue was that I talked way too much about trauma I was overthinking all the symptoms and etc
I also started dating a guy which I cut off as he wasn’t honest about his intentions and it felt like a heartbreak. Normally I would not care but this time it caused such an emotional overwhelm I can’t even describe. I also had massive stress at work. So with all together since January I started noticing that I’m feeling low, panic attacks, health anxiety and getting very overwhelmed.
I had to get signed off from work 2 weeks ago. I can’t read books,listen to music,process complex info, even writing this takes so much energy. I cant sleep cause of constant racing thoughts and I feel i’m going crazy.
I’m living with my cat, my family is supportive but oversea. Also, I can’t even distract myself as at some point movies or even tik tok can overwhelm me to the point that I vomit. Eating is hard. Lost weight. Contacted my GP(doctor) to see if I can get some meds to pull me out a bit.
If anyone has or had a similar experience please let me know. I really need to know it’s gonna get better ❤️‍🩹 as at the moment it feels hopeless.
Also if some of you are on some meds pls let me know how it goes.

1jcwy9j,2025-03-17 04:00:28,My Nervous/Endo Systems are Wrecked (Such a Mess),"I sometimes think that I’m bulletproof and can’t be killed by conventional means. 
I’ve been shot at twice. I’ve been stabbed twice. I was in a jeep that rolled 3.5 times and landed in a ditch. I lost consciousness while driving due to an adverse reaction to medication (the medication was nothing “sexy”) while doing 70mph on the highway. I’ve been hit with bottles, a baseball bat. I once had a wooden platform shoe broken across my shoulders. 
I was poisoned and died for two minutes. I drowned as a child.

I once went into an active house fire to help a complete stranger. 

None of that bothers me. I don’t ever really think about any of it in a way that triggers anything. 

Three things fuck me up:
1. Being emotionally close to someone (in any intimate manner) who then completely vanishes on me. (Major)

2. Seeing/hearing/thinking that a person or members of a certain group are in distress and being unable to help. (Major)

3. Losing, misplacing, or otherwise being unable to find something (Medium to Major)

My body will flood with cortisol, and I can’t think about anything else. 

I will occasionally have nightmares about the overlap between a past occupation and some personal experiences. 

I saw a loved one struggle while swimming once, and that caused me to freeze up. Some people suggested it was my personal experience with drowning. It actually stemmed from a different experience dealing with the aftermath of someone else drowning. 

In a stunningly absurd series of events, I thought I saw someone i cared about being harmed in a video (it wasn’t), and I spent a half hour on my bathroom floor. I told this person about this but in a fairly abstract manner, minimizing the impact it had on me. 

In a former occupation, my boss (a former Marine, US Air Marshal, and gang task force drug interdiction cop) told me I was the most composed person he’d ever met. 

I could speak to people in a conversational manner…while literally fighting with them (usually it was a situation where they were about to severely injure themselves). 

I had an experience where a person i was with felt threatened, and without even thinking, I put myself between her and the threat…who, as it turned out, was armed. And whatever the hell my face did was enough to deter that threat. 

I’m in such a wreck right now, and no one can see it, but it literally feels like I’m being torn apart inside.

I’m spending the day with a loved, brilliant relative who will have to go home soon, and she has no idea that anything is off with me. When she leaves, im going to let myself fall apart for a bit and try to keep myself busy. 

I’ve been trying to hold a fractured family together. Someone with some severe problems. A grieving widow who probably will never recover from her loss. A confused but brilliant young person. I work up to 80 hours a week sometimes to stay occupied and to cover always growing financial concerns. 

Summoning my inner angst-ridden teenaged self: despite having explained much of these issues to family members, they either don’t get it or can’t get it. They just think I’m self-absorbed and/or lazy. 

I let myself get close to someone in a very unorthodox situation (and probably very stupid in retrospect). She told me that I made her feel heard, and so much of my personal value is based on my utility. And she disappeared. I have no way of getting in touch with this person. My nervous system feels flooded with acid. (She never knew about any of this, and I never make any of this anyone’s responsibility). 

My heart rate only went up about 10bpm the last time I was shot at. But my hands are shaking right now. It’s so ridiculous that I want to laugh. 

I’ve been to therapy and tried any number of treatments.  Nothing has worked. 

The only thing that regularly quells any of this? Being in the middle of a crisis. I’ll be the eye of the storm when everyone else is frantic.

1jffs21,2025-03-20 09:22:57,How do people without this disorder feel emotions?,"I’ve always wondered this. Every emotion I feel is so complex yet so strong. I feel my emotions consume me and I can feel them somatically, physically. I’m better at cognitively regulating and handling my emotions, but that doesn’t take away from their strength.

When I’m happy, I’m not just happy. I’m euphoric. Everything is beautiful, I’m full of hope, I feel great about myself and the people and world around me. I feel my body tingle and seemingly lift up, but with that sense of euphoria also comes a sense of restlessness and anxiety.

When I’m angry, I’m furious. It’s a feeling of pure wrath, and it feels like I’m the embodiment of hatred and malice itself. Dare I say it’s murderous (not in the sense that I’d actually kill someone). But at the same time I feel incredibly guilty for getting mad in the first place. My body gets hot and tingly, but in a shaky, pins and needles type of way. I literally want to see the whole world (and especially that specific person, if a person is involved) burn and suffer.

When I’m sad, it’s like the world is literally crumbling around me and I’m surrounded by a dark, cold void that’s trying to suck me in. I get that tingle, but it’s like a shiver down my spine and in my head. My body feels really heavy. But at the same time there’s also a literal warmth inside that comes from me sort of romanticizing it. Whenever I get like that, I tend to reflect on everything and find the beauty in being able to experience every emotion, and in turn what it means to be human, in its rawest, most extreme and visceral form.

And then there’s dissociation/emptiness. That’s just pure dread and I feel don’t anything in my body except a lifted-ness that comes from being disconnected. Experiencing the void it’s the worst feeling to me.

1jg8jnt,2025-03-21 10:19:03,"After three years, I think I finally understand my ex w/ BPD, and I've come full circle (in a good way).","My ex and I broke up nearly three years ago, and the journey after the fact has been complicated.

I didn't know she had BPD (being she's in the Quiet\\Discouraged subtype), and because how much emotional damage the final couple of weeks did to me, I was bitter and angry for a long time. I never sent anything abusive her way nor was I cruel to her when I found out, but I was in a deeply raw place.

I gave into a lot of stigmatizing rhetoric, and closed my heart to empathy. This didn't line up with my values, but my entire world had been turned upside down by this break up, and my value system went with it.

Last year, however, when my cat got sick (a cat that she had been quite close with), we reconnected. And when we met up for the first time in literally years, it was like nothing ever happened. That same electricity. That same spark. And it didn't take long for me to remember exactly why I fell in love with her to begin with.

She was kind, intelligent, curious, and she had this childlike sense of wonder that I found utterly compelling. I'd been severely depressed for weeks, but all of a sudden, it was like my brain came back to life.

We were sensible in our conversations following. She told me that seeing me had made her ""feel whole in a way \[she\] hadn't in a long time"", and suddenly, we were texting away again. It didn't take long for us to talk about getting back together, but we also both knew that the relationship ended for a reason. And we needed to discuss those reasons if we were going to commit once more.

And once again, she really impressed me. She took accountability and responsibility for her side of the break up in a way I didn't think was even possible for someone with BPD, and it began fundamentally shift my view. My stigmas were melting away in the face of direct evidence that BPDers are capable of growth. It might not be as easy, but the proof was in the pudding.

She didn't just give me some platitude, she broke down exactly what went wrong without me giving her any clues or prompts. She demonstrated a true understanding, and made me feel safe to take responsibility for my own side as well.

We didn't get back together, unfortunately. As we were negotiating, she suddenly contracted COVID and needed to rush her brother's dogs to the emergency room. And when you combine that with her heavy workload as a then-paralegal (now law graduate!!), she began to unravel mentally, and ended up being hospitalised again. 

We entered a will-they, won't-they phase, where there was still romantic language being used, but her mental health struggles were creating a block from moving forward.

And other things have happened since. Very positive, healing things, but events best left for another post. 

She's now with someone else, though I worry it might be a coping mechanism or avoidance of her issues, as she confided in me that she's ""trying not to think about"" her ongoing mental health issues, and this was around about the time she was exploring this new guy as an option. She's, of course, free to explore whatever new avenues of love she wishes, and I've voiced an enormous amount of support for her decision via text message. I just worry that things might be adding up to this being part of a larger mental health crisis bubbling under the surface.   
  
Again, though, I'll save that for another time.

My point for this post is that I'd gone from believing the stigmatizing narratives surrounding BPD to seeing what it really was.

My ex is a deeply traumatized woman. Not a monster. Not a succubus nor a demon. She's a woman. A human being dominated by deeply held fears that control her life to the point of distorting her very view of reality. 

Her brain might feel supported one moment, and unworthy the next. Struggling with that all too human longing for connection and friendship versus the fears that come with it: 

\-The fear of losing people. 

\-The fear of losing herself to something too big, too fast. 

\-The fear of being unworthy of the love & support that is so freely given to someone as wonderful as her.

I see the turmoil. The inner conflict. The struggle with identity itself. The need to push people away so they don't abandon her first. And I finally understand how it manifested in the contradictory, often hurtful behaviour that I saw. I won't defend the behaviour, but I now see what it was at its root: Pain & fear.

I see her now. Truly see her. And she's no less beautiful to me now than she was the day I met her.

Having BPD doesn't make someone any less deserving of being loved. And I do love her, and I think I always will. The kind of feelings I have for her are the sort that never truly go away, even as you ride along to greener pastures.

It's not up for me to decide her ultimate destiny, but I hope that wherever she ends up, she is surrounded by people who see her, and understand that her lower moments aren't carefully crafted to hurt people, but are instead deeply rooted, automated defence mechanisms by her deepest fears.

And no matter what, she will always have my support. My friendship. And I will always stand up for her.

My ex and I broke up nearly three years ago, and the journey after the fact has been complicated.

I didn't know she had BPD (being she's in the Quiet\\Discouraged subtype), and because how much emotional damage the final couple of weeks did to me, I was bitter and angry for a long time. I never sent anything abusive her way nor was I cruel to her when I found out, but I was in a deeply raw place.

I gave into a lot of stigmatizing rhetoric, and closed my heart to empathy. This didn't line up with my values, but my entire world had been turned upside down by this break up, and my value system went with it.

Last year, however, when my cat got sick (a cat that she had been quite close with), we reconnected. And when we met up for the first time in literally years, it was like nothing ever happened. That same electricity. That same spark. And it didn't take long for me to remember exactly why I fell in love with her to begin with.

She was kind, intelligent, curious, and she had this childlike sense of wonder that I found utterly compelling. I'd been severely depressed for weeks, but all of a sudden, it was like my brain came back to life.

We were sensible in our conversations following. She told me that seeing me had made her ""feel whole in a way \[she\] hadn't in a long time"", and suddenly, we were texting away again. It didn't take long for us to talk about getting back together, but we also both knew that the relationship ended for a reason. And we needed to discuss those reasons if we were going to commit once more.

And once again, she really impressed me. She took accountability and responsibility for her side of the break up in a way I didn't think was even possible for someone with BPD, and it began fundamentally shift my view. My stigmas were melting away in the face of direct evidence that BPDers are capable of growth. It might not be as easy, but the proof was in the pudding.

She didn't just give me some platitude, she broke down exactly what went wrong without me giving her any clues or prompts. She demonstrated a true understanding, and made me feel safe to take responsibility for my own side as well.

We didn't get back together, unfortunately. As we were negotiating, she suddenly contracted COVID and needed to rush her brother's dogs to the emergency room. And when you combine that with her heavy workload as a then-paralegal (now law graduate!!), she began to unravel mentally, and ended up being hospitalised again. 

We entered a will-they, won't-they phase, where there was still romantic language being used, but her mental health struggles were creating a block from moving forward.

And other things have happened since. Very positive, healing things, but events best left for another post. 

She's now with someone else, though I worry it might be a coping mechanism or avoidance of her issues, as she confided in me that she's ""trying not to think about"" her ongoing mental health issues, and this was around about the time she was exploring this new guy as an option. She's, of course, free to explore whatever new avenues of love she wishes, and I've voiced an enormous amount of support for her decision via text message. I just worry that things might be adding up to this being part of a larger mental health crisis bubbling under the surface.   
  
Again, though, I'll save that for another time.

My point for this post is that I'd gone from believing the stigmatizing narratives surrounding BPD to seeing what it really was.

My ex is a deeply traumatized woman. Not a monster. Not a succubus nor a demon. She's a woman. A human being dominated by deeply held fears that control her life to the point of distorting her very view of reality. 

Her brain might feel supported one moment, and unworthy the next. Struggling with that all too human longing for connection and friendship versus the fears that come with it: 

\-The fear of losing people. 

\-The fear of losing herself to something too big, too fast. 

\-The fear of being unworthy of the love & support that is so freely given to someone as wonderful as her.

I see the turmoil. The inner conflict. The struggle with identity itself. The need to push people away so they don't abandon her first. And I finally understand how it manifested in the contradictory, often hurtful behaviour that I saw. I won't defend the behaviour, but I now see what it was at its root: Pain & fear.

I see her now. Truly see her. And she's no less beautiful to me now than she was the day I met her.

Having BPD doesn't make someone any less deserving of being loved. And I do love her, and I think I always will. The kind of feelings I have for her are the sort that never truly go away, even as you ride along to greener pastures.

It's not up for me to decide her ultimate destiny, but I hope that wherever she ends up, she is surrounded by people who see her, and understand that her lower moments aren't carefully crafted to hurt people, but are instead deeply rooted, automated defence mechanisms by her deepest fears.

And no matter what, she will always have my support. My friendship. And I will always stand up for her.

And if she wants to eventually give it a go again, she has that option too. I'm not saying this will happen, only that the door will always be open to her, if our status as single lines up once more.

There's still so much left to learn, and I might ask some questions in future posts regarding that, but I really feel like I've made a breakthrough in a way that I simply hadn't before.

I often feel like I can feel others’ emotional or even physical pain or other sensations, good and bad (even down to sexual sensations sometimes which is kinda wild) like it’s my own.

1jdbzmr,2025-03-17 18:57:02,Advice on staging an intervention with a friend with BPD who's being inappropriate with female friends?,"Hi! First time poster here, please feel free to correct me if I say something wrong or in anyway stigmatizing about BPD

I'm part of an amateur theatre group who have created a really good community and we're all really good friends. It's a pretty diverse group with a wide range of ages and we get along pretty well! One person within the group has BPD (we'll call him David) and this is something we've known about and hasn't presented any issues.

Within the last 6 months or so we've spent a lot of time together as a group and it's clear that we have become the only real friends David has and he's put us all on a pedestal more and more, particularly since he broke up with his girlfriend. This has increasingly become a problem with a few women within the group who he has become close with.

While it's not been romantic/sexual in nature, he's been crossing certain boundaries with these people, calling them constantly, unloading emotionally on them whenever he feels the slightest hint of a negative feeling, and getting upset with them (one girl in particular) if she doesn't drop everything to help him with any problem he may be facing.

The girl in question is 18 while he's 22 which may not be that big of a deal but she's only just moved away from living at home with her parents and she's kinda naïve which is why I think she wasn't aware of what is and isn't appropriate in normal friendships. I've spoken to her and she's said that she enjoys being his friend and he's not been like creepy to her but it's just a lot for her to handle, particularly when he experienced quite a severe mental health crisis and was engaging in self-harm.

As someone who has been involved in the theatre group the longest and has some responsibility within the organization, I feel kinda responsible, because it's become a bit of a pattern with new people that join. I've decided that this can't really go on and that I need to talk to him. How talk about appropriate boundaries without hurting him or triggering another mental health crisis?
